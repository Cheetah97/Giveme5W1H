  "description": "James Comey says batch of emails \u2018have not changed conclusion\u2019 but Trump doubts review, saying: \u2018You can\u2019t review 650,000 emails in eight days\u2019",
  "text": "The FBI has determined that a new batch of emails linked to Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server \u201chave not changed our conclusion\u201d that she committed no criminal wrongdoing, FBI director James Comey told congressional leaders in a letter on Sunday. FBI director's troubles just beginning after latest twist in Clinton email tale Read more As campaigning continued ahead of Tuesday\u2019s presidential election, a Clinton spokeswoman said the candidate was \u201cglad this matter is resolved\u201d. The Democratic nominee\u2019s opponent, Donald Trump, reacted with anger at the news, and cast doubt on whether the FBI had even carried out its work. \u201cYou can\u2019t review 650,000 emails in eight days,\u201d Donald Trump told a campaign rally in Sterling Heights, Michigan, on Sunday evening. On 28 October, only 11 days before the presidential election, Comey sent congressional leaders a letter informing them that agents had discovered emails \u201cthat appear pertinent\u201d to a prior investigation, into Clinton\u2019s use of a private server while she was secretary of state. It was later reported that as many as 650,000 such emails were in question. The move, so close to an election, proved tremendously controversial. In July, Comey had announced that Clinton and her aides were \u201cextremely careless\u201d but that \u201cno reasonable prosecutor\u201d would bring a case against them. \u201cSince my letter, the FBI investigative team has been working around the clock to process and review a large volume of emails from a device obtained in connection with an unrelated criminal investigation,\u201d Comey wrote to Congress on Sunday. \u201cDuring that process, we reviewed all of the communications that were to or from Hillary Clinton while she was secretary of state. \u201cBased on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton,\u201d he concluded. \u201cI am grateful to the professionals at the FBI for doing an extraordinary amount of high-quality work in a short period of time.\u201d Clinton was onboard her campaign plane when the news broke, as she had been when Comey delivered his first letter nine days earlier. As news broke, aides huddled toward the front of the plane, reading from an iPad, and spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri entered Clinton\u2019s cabin, shielded by a curtain, moments before she spoke to the press. \u201cWe are glad to see that [Comey] has found, as we were confident he would, that he has confirmed the conclusions that he reached in July and we are glad that this matter is resolved,\u201d she told reporters. Hillary Clinton retains edge over Donald Trump in election's final sprint Read more Leaving the plane in Cleveland, roughly 30 minutes after Comey\u2019s announcement, Clinton did not respond to a reporter\u2019s question about whether she had seen the letter. When the letter was released, Trump was speaking in an airplane hangar in Minneapolis, but did not mention the letter to the crowd, instead directing his anger against his Democratic rival. In Michigan, however, he said: \u201cYou can\u2019t review 650,000 emails in eight days. Hillary Clinton is guilty. She knows it. The FBI knows it, the people know it and now it is up for American people to deliver justice at the ballot box on 8 November.\u201d The Republican nominee also insisted that despite Comey\u2019s actions, \u201cthe rank and file special agents at the FBI won\u2019t let her get away with her terrible crimes including the deletion of 33,000 emails after receiving a federal subpoena\u201d. Trump seemed to be alluding to leaks from within the bureau that revealed acrimony and political rifts within the FBI, after Department of Justice officials expressed surprise that Comey would break with decades of tradition regarding investigations and elections. Other leading Republicans tried to dismiss the FBI\u2019s new conclusion. \u201cSome things haven\u2019t changed at all. What FBI director Comey said on 7 July under oath to Congress is still the same: that she was reckless and careless in her handling of information,\u201d Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, told MSNBC. \u201cThe reason that so many Americans have a problem with Hillary Clinton\u2019s honesty and trustworthiness and veracity does not change.\u201d Republican House speaker Paul Ryan also insisted that the new conclusion should not change any opinions about Clinton. \u201cRegardless of this decision, the undisputed finding of the FBI\u2019s investigation is that Secretary Clinton put our nation\u2019s secrets at risk and in doing so compromised our national security,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cShe simply believes she\u2019s above the law and always plays by her own rules.\u201d End this misogynistic horror show. Put Hillary Clinton in the White House | Barbara Kingsolver Read more Although Ryan has endured spats with Trump for months, he urged Americans to vote for the businessman, as he did last week. \u201cFortunately, the American people have the opportunity to ensure Secretary Clinton never gets her hands on classified information again,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cLet\u2019s bring the Clinton era to an end by voting for Donald Trump on Tuesday.\u201d The new emails were discovered on a laptop belonging to Anthony Weiner, a disgraced former congressman who is the estranged husband of Huma Abedin, a close aide to Clinton. Weiner is under investigation for allegedly exchanging sexually explicit messages with a minor. Comey\u2019s first letter surprised both campaigns and cast the FBI into the middle of an bitter and volatile race. Senior Democrats accused Comey of political meddling, Clinton said she found the letter \u201cdeeply troubling\u201d and Trump gleefully predicted the emails would reveal a corruption scandal \u201cbigger than Watergate\u201d. On Sunday, Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, said Comey\u2019s letter should end \u201conce and for all\u201d accusations that Clinton had committed any crime. \u201cWhile the original letter should never have been sent so close to an election,\u201d Schiff said, \u201cthe expeditious review of these emails should put to rest the irresponsible speculation indulged in by the Trump campaign and others.\u201d 'The FBI is Trumpland': anti-Clinton atmosphere spurred leaking, sources say Read more The FBI said it had nothing to add to Comey\u2019s letter. Yet while the immediate drama has ended, Comey remains in a precarious position. John Conyers, the ranking Democrat on the House judiciary committee, hinted at political battles to come, saying: \u201cWe will have many questions about the FBI\u2019s handling of this investigation.\u201d Senator Dianne Feinstein, usually a staunch ally of the security agencies, said the end of what she called Comey\u2019s \u201cOctober surprise\u201d made his decision to intervene \u201ceven more troubling\u201d. Feinstein called on the justice department to \u201clook at its procedures to prevent similar actions that could influence future elections\u201d.",
