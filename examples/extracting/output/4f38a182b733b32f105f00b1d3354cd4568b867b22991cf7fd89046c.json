Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email Hillary Clinton received a major boost just two days before the election after the FBI found no evidence of criminality in a new batch of her emails. In a letter to members of Congress, FBI director James Comey said the bureau had finished its review and found nothing to change its previous position. Four months ago he said Clinton had been careless but not criminal in handling classified material on her private email server while secretary of state.

The computer was seized by investigators probing her husband, former politician Anthony Weiner, following claims he sexted an underage girl. The emails were understood to stretch back years and were on a laptop both Weiner and Abedin used and that hadn\u2019t previously been searched in the earlier Clinton probe. \u201cI write to supplement my October 28, 2016 letter that notified you the FBI would be taking additional investigative steps with respect to former Secretary of State Clinton's use of a personal email server,\u201d said Mr Comey in a letter to Congress today. (Photo: Getty Images) \u201cSince my letter, the FBI investigative team has been working around the clock to process and review a large volume of emails from a device obtained in connection with an unrelated criminal investigation. \u201cDuring that process, we reviewed all of the communications that were to or from Hillary Clinton while she was Secretary of State. \"Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton.\u201d How Did The Email Scandal Start? (Photo: Getty Images) While she was Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton kept her own email server in her home in Chappaqua, New York. She had an official state.gov email address, but she never used it, she says because it would have involved having to carry two Smartphones around - one of them a \u2018secure\u2019 government model. Instead, all of her personal and work correspondence was filtered into her home email address - hdr22@clintonemail.com Sceptics claim it had nothing to do with convenience, and she just wanted to be sure that all of her correspondence was exempt from Freedom of information laws. She also set up addresses on the server for aides including Chief of staff Cheryl Mills and long-time aide Huma Abedin. Click here for our full guide to the Hillary Clinton email scandal.",
