  "text": "Chicago Cubs players soaked each other with champagne as they celebrated their Nov. 2 World Series victory. (Reuters) Chicago Cubs players soaked each other with champagne as they celebrated their Nov. 2 World Series victory. (Reuters) Life changed in the early part of Thursday morning for so many of the good people of Chicago, for the North Side and all the way downstate, across huge swaths of the Midwest and even, judging by the din, from more than a few transplants and travelers right here. It took a rain delay, a stark reminder of just how disastrous baseball life has been there for so long, an impromptu and emotional meeting, and nothing short of one of the most thrilling baseball games ever played. But it changed. Now, in the lives even of Chicago Cubs fans who are more than a century old, there is a clear and distinct dividing line. There are the days and years and decades before 12:47 a.m. Thursday. And there is the unfamiliar feeling \u2014 the absolutely delirious feeling \u2014 of whatever life is like now. Take this in, Chicago. Read it twice if need be. Hold it, cradle it, caress it, cherish it. The Cubs won the World Series. [Thomas Boswell: Finally, a time to rejoice for legions of sufferers] They did it with a riveting, 8-7, 10-inning victory over the Cleveland Indians in the seventh and final game at Progressive Field, one that tore out the lining of Chicago\u2019s roiling stomach before stitching it back together again. The simple part: Ben Zobrist\u2019s double off Cleveland reliever Bryan Shaw pushed across the lead run, Miguel Montero followed with a run-scoring single, and Chicago . . . Chicago . . . Hint: There were only 46 states. (Gillian Brockell/The Washington Post) What to make of Chicago now? \u201cIt\u2019s 108 years, generations, some still here, some not,\u201d said Theo Epstein, the Cubs president of baseball operations. \u201cThey were all here tonight.\u201d There is so much more to how the Cubs won their first World Series title since 1908, more than could be covered in the 17-minute rain delay that preceded just the 10th inning of \u2014 get this \u2014 just the fourth extra-inning Game 7 the World Series has ever known. \u201cThis one about made me pass out,\u201d Zobrist said. How to distill it? Well, maybe with the most Cubs\u2019 fact of all: They held a three-run lead in the bottom of the eighth, with four outs to go. They had their 100-mph closer on the mound to seal it up. And they couldn\u2019t do it. Suddenly, 2016 was going to fit right alongside 2003 and 1984 and all the rest. That backstory, and the fact that it was 68 years since the Indians\u2019 last World Series title, colored this entire event. \u201cThere\u2019s been a burden placed,\u201d Cubs Manager Joe Maddon said. \u201cAnd I think, quite frankly, it\u2019s misplaced. . . . I totally respect what\u2019s happened in the past, and I totally respect our fan base. But if you just want to carry the burden with you all the time, tonight would never happen.\u201d 1 of 26 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 The Chicago Cubs win World Series View Photos The Chicago Cubs won their first title since 1908 with a riveting, 8-7, 10-inning victory over the Cleveland Indians in the seventh and final game at Progressive Field. Caption The team won its first title since 1908 with a riveting 8-7, 10-inning victory over the Cleveland Indians in the seventh and final game at Progressive Field. Nov. 2, 2016 The Cubs celebrate after winning the World Series. Matt Slocum/AP Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. It did. So clear off the table. Spread out the evidence. Take a deep breath. Let\u2019s sort this out. The Cubs took what appeared to be control \u2014 a laughable notion in Wrigleyville, for sure \u2014 by going up 5-1 in the fifth, with all the runs coming off Cleveland ace Corey Kluber and impenetrable reliever Andrew Miller. And yet, when Maddon went to get starter Kyle Hendricks in the fifth, there were potential issues. Asked before the game whether he would insert veteran left-handed starter Jon Lester into a situation with men on base, Maddon was clear. \u201cI don\u2019t think it would be appropriate,\u201d he said. Lester has an awful time holding base runners on due to an absolute phobia of throwing a baseball \u2014 other than 60 feet, 6 inches. Yet he entered \u2014 along with David Ross, his personal catcher \u2014 with two outs and a man on first in the fifth. For the first time, things went a bit haywire. Not in the Cubs\u2019 history, of course. But for the first time Wednesday night. Jason Kipnis hit a spinner in front of the plate that Ross misfired to first for an error, and Lester uncorked a wild pitch that was so wild, it scored two runs. Progressive Field, filled with plenty of Cubs fans, shook with the glee from Cleveland\u2019s own. \u201cYou don\u2019t think about storybooks and stuff like that,\u201d Cleveland Manger Terry Francona said. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to figure out a way to score one more run.\u201d When Lester departed with two outs in the eighth, he received and deserved congratulations. The last of his 55 pitches became an infield single to Jose Ramirez. But when Maddon turned to Aroldis Chapman, his closer, the situation was manageable: 6-3 lead, one on, one out to get in the eighth, then three more to get in the ninth. \u201cPeople are texting me congrats,\u201d Epstein said. \u201cI\u2019m like, [expletive]. This is baseball. Anything can happen.\u201d So it did. Twice in this series, Chapman entered in the seventh. And as the Cubs crawled back from what had been a 3-1 deficit, he was asked to get the final eight outs of Game 5, then four more outs in Tuesday\u2019s Game 6. The first hitter he faced was Brandon Guyer, and it was clear immediately that Chapman\u2019s velocity \u2014 his defining quality \u2014 was down. \u201cI think if you\u2019re being honest, I feel like the entirety of the playoffs probably did take its toll on him,\u201d Cubs General Manager Jed Hoyer. \u201cI think that he\u2019s probably tired, as he should be.\u201d [ End of Cubs\u2019 championship drought brings forth a mighty sound ] Normally the hardest thrower in the game, with a fastball that averages more than 100 mph, Chapman settled in immediately at 97 mph. Hard to deal with, for sure. But not his overwhelming self. So Guyer cranked a double to right-center that scored a run. Cleveland all but shook as Rajai Davis came to the plate. Davis, in the lineup for his defense, had gained confidence against Chapman earlier in the series. \u201cI just felt like this was going to be a fight,\u201d he said, \u201cthat I was going to win.\u201d Chapman fed Davis nothing but four-seam fastballs. He missed with two out of the zone, but there was a telling development: the four that were strikes, Davis didn\u2019t swing and miss. He fouled them off. \u201cHe was battling,\u201d Montero said of Chapman. With the count 2-2, Chapman came with his seventh straight fastball, this one at 97 mph. Davis jumped on it. It wasn\u2019t majestic. Just historic. It went into the corner in left field, near the foul pole. When it cleared the wall, the Indians spilled out of their dugout like Little Leaguers. Tie game. \u201cJust ecstatic,\u201d Shaw said. And then at the end of the ninth, the skies opened up. The tarp came out. \u201cI really feel like in some ways that rain delay was kind of divine intervention,\u201d Hoyer said. \u201cThe game was going really fast for us at that point.\u201d Epstein and Hoyer went under the stands to meet with officials from Major League Baseball about the plan and the weather. They then slipped into the Cubs clubhouse, where the hitters who were due up the next inning were meeting. [\u2018Cubs had a great night. Bill Murray\u2019s was better.] \u201cI got a little concerned,\u201d Epstein said. He cracked open the door. Right fielder Jason Heyward \u2014 he of the $184 million contract and the .200 postseason batting average \u2014 had called the guys together. \u201cI\u2019ve got something to say,\u201d Zobrist recalled Heyward saying. And he talked about this epic game, and this epic team. He told them they would win. \u201cWe just needed a brief moment to kind of collect ourselves and be reminded of who we are,\u201d Heyward said. And who they were about to become. In the 10th, Zobrist came up with two on and one out against Shaw. Maddon believes Zobrist consistently delivers the Cubs\u2019 best at-bats. Here, he fouled off one 1-2 cutter from Shaw. He didn\u2019t miss the next, sending it into left field, scoring Almora with the run that put them up 7-6. Turns out they needed Montero\u2019s RBI single, too, because Davis somehow managed to push one across for the Indians in the bottom of the 10th. \u201cI died like six times,\u201d Epstein said. So start the conversation: Where does this Game 7 fit, all-time? Debate it Thursday, over the weekend, for 108 years. Epstein considered it after 2 a.m., standing on the mound at Progressive Field where he had just taken a picture with the front office he runs. Rain poured down, and he looked up into it. \u201cEveryone\u2019s prone to hyperbole on nights like tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it is kind of epic, right?\u201d Routine, three-run victories don\u2019t change life.
