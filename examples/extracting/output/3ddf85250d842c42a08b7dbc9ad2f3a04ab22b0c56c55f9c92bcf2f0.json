  "text": "A TOP aide to failed US presidential contender Hillary Clinton has blamed the election of rival Donald Trump on the head of the FBI. A scathing letter by Navin Nayak, head of Clinton\u2019s research division, pinned the cause of her candidate\u2019s loss on FBI director James Comey. EPA 6 Clinton was investigated by the FBI in the days before the election over her use of private emails Splash News 6 FBI director James Comey cleared Clinton of wrongdoing days before Americans went to the polls AP:Associated Press 6 Clinton fans wept as she conceded defeat in the US election Comey announced a probe into the Democrat\u2019s private emails found on shamed sext-text former congressman Anthony Weiner\u2019s laptop just weeks before the election. But Nayak said that Comey\u2019s second announcement clearing Clinton of wrongdoing days before Americans went to the polls actually HELPED billionaire Trump reach the White House. \u201cWe believe that we lost this election in the last week\u201d, she wrote in the letter seen by Politico.

HILLARY'S LAST HOPE Hillary Clinton could still end up in the White House in one possible scenario that could shake America HE'S GONE SOFT! Donald Trump fans slam soon-to-be president for praising Hillary Clinton during his acceptance speech \u201cComey\u2019s letter in the last 11 days of the election both helped depress our turnout and also drove away some of our critical support among college-educated white voters \u2014 particularly in the suburbs\u201d. \u201cWe also think Comey\u2019s 2nd letter, which was intended to absolve Sec. Clinton, actually helped to bolster Trump\u2019s turnout.\u201d Clinton was set to win up until the last week of the election, according to Nayak. \u201cVoters who decided in the last week broke for Trump by a larger margin\u2026\u201d she explained. \u201cThese numbers were even more exaggerated in the key battleground states.\u201d 6 A probe was launched into Clinton when police searching the laptop of sext-pest Anthony Weiner \u2013 husband of a top Clinton aide \u2013 found 600,000 emails from Clinton Getty Images 6 Victorious Trump met President Obama for the first time on Thursday The FBI chief issued two bombshell letters to Congress right before the election. The first disclosed that agents had seized a laptop shared by Clinton aide Huma Abedin and her husband Anthony Weiner. The laptop contained more than 600,000 emails related to a previous investigation into Clinton\u2019s private email server, which was wrapped up in July. Several days later, Comey issued a second letter saying the FBI had analyzed the new materials and hadn\u2019t changed its conclusion that there was no reason to prosecute Clinton. Nayak said the second letter \u201cenergized Trump supporters.\u201d She also noted that after record early voting numbers, there was a significant drop in turnout in cities like Philadelphia, Raleigh-Durham, Milwaukee and Detroit when the first letter became public. \u201cIn the end, late breaking developments in the race proved one hurdle too many for us to overcome,\u201d Nayak said.
