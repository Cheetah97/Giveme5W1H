  "description": "CLEVELAND -- Goat to hell.\n\n\n\nThere probably isn't a soul remaining on the planet who watched the Cubs celebrate their World Series title 108 years ago, but plenty of witnesses will exist for years to come who can document what occurred in the early minutes of Thursday morning.\n\n\n\nCall it what you might: Wile E. Coyote catching the Road Runner, pigs flying, apocalypse now. The Cubs officially obliterated the Curse of the Billy Goat with a 8-7 victory over the Indians in 10 innings in Game 7 of the World Series before 38,104 at Progressive Field.\n\n\n\n\"That's one of the best games anyone will ever see,\" Kris Bryant said after the Cubs scored twice in the 10th inning and then survived an Indians rally to secure the franchise's first World Series championship since 1908. The baton was passed to the Indians, still without a World Series title since 1948, as the franchise enduring the longest championship drought in baseball.\n\n\n\nBen Zobrist slashed an RBI double against Bryan Shaw for the go-ahead run and Miguel Montero's ensuing single added another.\n\n\n\nCubs reliever Mike Montgomery retired Michael Martinez on a grounder to third with the tying run on first base, after the Indians had scored once in the bottom of the inning, to start the celebration. Zobrist was named MVP of the series after going 10-for-28 (.357) with two RBIs.\n\n\n\n\"It was just an epic battle,\" Zobrist said. \"We've been listening to 'Rocky's' soundtrack the last three games. It was like a heavyweight fight. I can't believe we're finally standing, after 108 years, finally able to hoist the trophy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDexter Fowler, Javier Baez and David Ross all homered for the Cubs and Kyle Hendricks combined with Jon Lester, Aroldis Chapman, Carl Edwards Jr. and Montgomery for the win after a 17-minute rain delay as the 10th inning was set to begin.\n\n\n\n\"We did it despite trying to give it away,\" Lester said.\n\n\n\nThe Cubs, who won 103 games in the regular season, became the first NL team to win the World Series after leading the majors in victories since the 1986 Mets.\n\n\n\nAnd manager Joe Maddon's crew became the first team to win it all after falling into a 3-1 deficit in the World Series since the 1985 Royals. The last previous team to accomplish it on the road was the 1979 Pirates.\n\n\n\n\"We have an opportunity to be good for awhile, without any of the constraints, without any of the negative dialogue,\" Maddon said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJaws dropped in the eighth when Rajai Davis' two-run homer against Chapman tied the score 6-6. Davis stroked a 97-mph fastball just over the left-field wall, breathing new life into an Indians dream had seemed dead just moments earlier. Brandon Guyer's RBI double earlier in the inning had left the Indians with a flicker of hope.\n\n\n\n\"It's going to hurt,\" Indians manager Terry Francona said. \"It hurts because we care, but they need to walk with their head held high because they left nothing on the field.\"\n\n\n\nChapman had worked 1 1/3 innings the previous night, throwing 20 pitches, but Maddon was confident before the game the lefty hadn't overextended himself. But Chapman was in tears during the rain delay and needed a boost.\n\n\n\n\"It happened and we told him, 'Don't worry, we'll pick you up,' \" Montero said. \"And we did.\"\n\n\n\nThe blast was redemption for Davis, who had two shaky fielding plays earlier in the game that helped the Cubs build a 6-3 lead.\n\n\n\nLester, who won Game 5 for the Cubs, helped the cause by pitching three innings in relief and allowing two runs, one of which was unearned, behind Hendricks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrancisco Lindor threw out Fowler motoring to first base for the final out of the ninth after Jason Heyward touched home plate with what would have been the go-ahead run for the Cubs. It came after Javier Baez bunted foul for strike three against Cody Allen, on a possible safety squeeze, for the second out.\n\n\n\nBryant's aggressive base running was as much a part of the equation as any of the Cubs' hits. The All-Star third baseman raced home on a fly ball to shallow center in the fourth inning to help the Cubs steal a run and then in the fifth was running on the pitch from first base and scored on Anthony Rizzo's single to give the Cubs a 6-3 lead.\n\n\n\nRoss hit the Cubs' third homer of the night, a solo blast against Andrew Miller in the sixth that stole the momentum from the Indians after they had reenergized their fans an inning earlier.\n\n\n\nHendricks was removed in the fifth, after walking Carlos Santana with two outs, and watched the Indians scrap back into the game facing Lester, whose arrival also brought the catcher Ross into the game.\n\n\n\nJason Kipnis reached on a swinging bunt and went to second after Ross' throw sailed away from Anthony Rizzo. With Lindor at the plate, Lester buried a curveball that bounced past Ross, allowing Santana to score, with Kipnis racing to the plate behind him, slicing the Cubs' lead to 5-3.\n\n\n\nBaez homered on the first pitch of the fifth inning to put the Indians in a 4-1 hole, knocking out Corey Kluber. The Indians ace allowed four earned runs on six hits over four innings, working on short rest for the third time in this postseason.\n\n\n\nFowler smashed Kluber's fourth pitch of the game for a homer. It was the second homer of the series for Fowler, who is set to become a free agent.",

  "text": "CLEVELAND -- Goat to hell. There probably isn't a soul remaining on the planet who watched the Cubs celebrate their World Series title 108 years ago, but plenty of witnesses will exist for years to come who can document what occurred in the early minutes of Thursday morning. Call it what you might: Wile E. Coyote catching the Road Runner, pigs flying, apocalypse now. The Cubs officially obliterated the Curse of the Billy Goat with a 8-7 victory over the Indians in 10 innings in Game 7 of the World Series before 38,104 at Progressive Field. \"That's one of the best games anyone will ever see,\" Kris Bryant said after the Cubs scored twice in the 10th inning and then survived an Indians rally to secure the franchise's first World Series championship since 1908. The baton was passed to the Indians, still without a World Series title since 1948, as the franchise enduring the longest championship drought in baseball. Ben Zobrist slashed an RBI double against Bryan Shaw for the go-ahead run and Miguel Montero's ensuing single added another. Cubs reliever Mike Montgomery retired Michael Martinez on a grounder to third with the tying run on first base, after the Indians had scored once in the bottom of the inning, to start the celebration. Zobrist was named MVP of the series after going 10-for-28 (.357) with two RBIs. \"It was just an epic battle,\" Zobrist said. \"We've been listening to 'Rocky's' soundtrack the last three games. It was like a heavyweight fight. I can't believe we're finally standing, after 108 years, finally able to hoist the trophy.\" Dexter Fowler, Javier Baez and David Ross all homered for the Cubs and Kyle Hendricks combined with Jon Lester, Aroldis Chapman, Carl Edwards Jr. and Montgomery for the win after a 17-minute rain delay as the 10th inning was set to begin. \"We did it despite trying to give it away,\" Lester said. The Cubs, who won 103 games in the regular season, became the first NL team to win the World Series after leading the majors in victories since the 1986 Mets. And manager Joe Maddon's crew became the first team to win it all after falling into a 3-1 deficit in the World Series since the 1985 Royals. The last previous team to accomplish it on the road was the 1979 Pirates. \"We have an opportunity to be good for awhile, without any of the constraints, without any of the negative dialogue,\" Maddon said. Jaws dropped in the eighth when Rajai Davis' two-run homer against Chapman tied the score 6-6. Davis stroked a 97-mph fastball just over the left-field wall, breathing new life into an Indians dream had seemed dead just moments earlier. Brandon Guyer's RBI double earlier in the inning had left the Indians with a flicker of hope. \"It's going to hurt,\" Indians manager Terry Francona said. \"It hurts because we care, but they need to walk with their head held high because they left nothing on the field.\" Chapman had worked 1 1/3 innings the previous night, throwing 20 pitches, but Maddon was confident before the game the lefty hadn't overextended himself. But Chapman was in tears during the rain delay and needed a boost. \"It happened and we told him, 'Don't worry, we'll pick you up,' \" Montero said. \"And we did.\" The blast was redemption for Davis, who had two shaky fielding plays earlier in the game that helped the Cubs build a 6-3 lead. Lester, who won Game 5 for the Cubs, helped the cause by pitching three innings in relief and allowing two runs, one of which was unearned, behind Hendricks.

It came after Javier Baez bunted foul for strike three against Cody Allen, on a possible safety squeeze, for the second out. Bryant's aggressive base running was as much a part of the equation as any of the Cubs' hits. The All-Star third baseman raced home on a fly ball to shallow center in the fourth inning to help the Cubs steal a run and then in the fifth was running on the pitch from first base and scored on Anthony Rizzo's single to give the Cubs a 6-3 lead. Ross hit the Cubs' third homer of the night, a solo blast against Andrew Miller in the sixth that stole the momentum from the Indians after they had reenergized their fans an inning earlier. Hendricks was removed in the fifth, after walking Carlos Santana with two outs, and watched the Indians scrap back into the game facing Lester, whose arrival also brought the catcher Ross into the game. Jason Kipnis reached on a swinging bunt and went to second after Ross' throw sailed away from Anthony Rizzo. With Lindor at the plate, Lester buried a curveball that bounced past Ross, allowing Santana to score, with Kipnis racing to the plate behind him, slicing the Cubs' lead to 5-3. Baez homered on the first pitch of the fifth inning to put the Indians in a 4-1 hole, knocking out Corey Kluber. The Indians ace allowed four earned runs on six hits over four innings, working on short rest for the third time in this postseason. Fowler smashed Kluber's fourth pitch of the game for a homer. It was the second homer of the series for Fowler, who is set to become a free agent.",
