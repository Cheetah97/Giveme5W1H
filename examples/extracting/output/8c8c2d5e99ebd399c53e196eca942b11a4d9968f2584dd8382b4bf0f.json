  "description": "CLEVELAND \u2014 Goat to hell.\n\n\n\nThere probably isn\u2019t a soul remaining on the planet who watched the Cubs celebrate their World Series title 108 years ago, but plenty of witnesses will exist for years to come who can document what occurred in the early minutes of Thursday morning.\n\n\n\nCall it what you might: Wile E. Coyote catching the Road Runner, pigs flying, apocalypse now. The Cubs officially obliterated the Curse of the Billy Goat with a 8-7 victory over the Indians in 10 innings in Game 7 of the World Series before 38,104 at Progressive Field.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the best games anyone will ever see,\u201d Kris Bryant said after the Cubs scored twice in the 10th inning and then survived an Indians rally to secure the franchise\u2019s first World Series championship since 1908. The baton was passed to the Indians, still without a World Series title since 1948, as the franchise enduring the longest championship drought in baseball.\n\n\n\nBen Zobrist slashed an RBI double against Bryan Shaw for the go-ahead run and Miguel Montero\u2019s ensuing single added another.\n\n\n\nCubs reliever Mike Montgomery retired Michael Martinez on a grounder to third with the tying run on first base, after the Indians had scored once in the bottom of the inning, to start the celebration. Zobrist was named MVP of the series after going 10-for-28 (.357) with two RBIs.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was just an epic battle,\u201d Zobrist said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been listening to \u2018Rocky\u2019s\u2019 soundtrack the last three games. It was like a heavyweight fight. I can\u2019t believe we\u2019re finally standing, after 108 years, finally able to hoist the trophy.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDexter Fowler, Javier Baez and David Ross all homered for the Cubs and Kyle Hendricks combined with Jon Lester, Aroldis Chapman, Carl Edwards Jr. and Montgomery for the win after a 17-minute rain delay as the 10th inning was set to begin.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe did it despite trying to give it away,\u201d Lester said.\n\n\n\nThe Cubs, who won 103 games in the regular season, became the first NL team to win the World Series after leading the majors in victories since the 1986 Mets.\n\n\n\nAnd manager Joe Maddon\u2019s crew became the first team to win it all after falling into a 3-1 deficit in the World Series since the 1985 Royals. The last previous team to accomplish it on the road was the 1979 Pirates.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have an opportunity to be good for awhile, without any of the constraints, without any of the negative dialogue,\u201d Maddon said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJaws dropped in the eighth when Rajai Davis\u2019 two-run homer against Chapman tied the score 6-6. Davis stroked a 97-mph fastball just over the left-field wall, breathing new life into an Indians dream had seemed dead just moments earlier. Brandon Guyer\u2019s RBI double earlier in the inning had left the Indians with a flicker of hope.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to hurt,\u201d Indians manager Terry Francona said. \u201cIt hurts because we care, but they need to walk with their head held high because they left nothing on the field.\u201d\n\n\n\nChapman had worked 1 \u00b9/\u2083 innings the previous night, throwing 20 pitches, but Maddon was confident before the game the lefty hadn\u2019t overextended himself. But Chapman was in tears during the rain delay and needed a boost.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt happened and we told him, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll pick you up,\u2019 \u201d Montero said. \u201cAnd we did.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe blast was redemption for Davis, who had two shaky fielding plays earlier in the game that helped the Cubs build a 6-3 lead.\n\n\n\nLester, who won Game 5 for the Cubs, helped the cause by pitching three innings in relief and allowing two runs, one of which was unearned, behind Hendricks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrancisco Lindor threw out Fowler motoring to first base for the final out of the ninth after Jason Heyward touched home plate with what would have been the go-ahead run for the Cubs. It came after Javier Baez bunted foul for strike three against Cody Allen, on a possible safety squeeze, for the second out.\n\n\n\nBryant\u2019s aggressive base running was as much a part of the equation as any of the Cubs\u2019 hits. The All-Star third baseman raced home on a fly ball to shallow center in the fourth inning to help the Cubs steal a run and then in the fifth was running on the pitch from first base and scored on Anthony Rizzo\u2019s single to give the Cubs a 6-3 lead.\n\n\n\nRoss hit the Cubs\u2019 third homer of the night, a solo blast against Andrew Miller in the sixth that stole the momentum from the Indians after they had reenergized their fans an inning earlier.\n\n\n\nHendricks was removed in the fifth, after walking Carlos Santana with two outs, and watched the Indians scrap back into the game facing Lester, whose arrival also brought the catcher Ross into the game.\n\n\n\nJason Kipnis reached on a swinging bunt and went to second after Ross\u2019 throw sailed away from Anthony Rizzo. With Lindor at the plate, Lester buried a curveball that bounced past Ross, allowing Santana to score, with Kipnis racing to the plate behind him, slicing the Cubs\u2019 lead to 5-3.\n\n\n\nBaez homered on the first pitch of the fifth inning to put the Indians in a 4-1 hole, knocking out Corey Kluber. The Indians ace allowed four earned runs on six hits over four innings, working on short rest for the third time in this postseason.\n\n\n\nFowler smashed Kluber\u2019s fourth pitch of the game for a homer. It was the second homer of the series for Fowler, who is set to become a free agent.",
