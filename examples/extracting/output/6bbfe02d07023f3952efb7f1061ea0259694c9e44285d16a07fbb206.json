  "text": "For Donald J. Trump, Sunday was about seeking a path to the presidency not blocked by Latino, black and Asian voters. He went to the Upper Midwest, into long-shot states like Minnesota that have not voted Republican for president in a generation. The final polls are trickling in and Clinton is retaining a modest lead nationally. According to a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal national poll, 44 percent of likely voters support Mrs. Clinton and 40 percent back Mr. Trump. Mrs. Clinton holds big leads with women and minority voters, while men, white voters and senior citizens buttress Mr. Trump\u2019s support. Mrs. Clinton is also doing better with those who have already cast their ballots, but Mr. Trump holds a lead among voters who plan to do so on Election Day.

Mr. Gingrich, a staunch ally of Mr. Trump and a finalist to be his running mate, said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that the Republican nominee would be doing much better if he had shown more discipline. \u201cI think he has hurt his campaign at times by saying things that were unwise, and I think at times he\u2019s been truly a historic figure,\u201d Mr. Gingrich said. Mr. Gingrich, a former Republican House speaker, praised Mr. Trump\u2019s big ideas and outreach to African-Americans. However, he suggested that Mr. Trump has often caused distractions from an otherwise strong message. \u201cOn the one hand, he\u2019s one of the most brilliant marketers I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Mr. Gingrich said. \u201cAnd on the other hand, for a while there, he was undercutting himself.\u201d He added: \u201cI suspect if he had not done that, he\u2019d be ahead by 10 or 15 points right now.\u201d Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

The chairman of the Nevada Republican Party, Michael McDonald, complained on Saturday night that some polls were being kept open longer than they should have been in Clark County so that \u201ca certain group\u201d could vote. On Sunday morning, Kellyanne Conway, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager, echoed that concern in an interview with CNN in which she suggested that \u201cspecial favors\u201d were being done for Democratic voters. \u201cIt\u2019s concerning when you hear reports about special favors and perhaps special rules for Democratic voters,\u201d Ms. Conway said, offering no evidence of a different set of rules. \u201cWe already know that their presidential nominee has special rules for her.\u201d Mr. Trump has for months complained of a rigged system and has said that if he loses the election and there are reports of problems at the polls he might challenge the result. PolitiFact gave Trump a \u201cPants on Fire\u201d grade over his claim that Obama abused a Trump supporter. In the final weekend of the race, Mr. Trump has been clinging to a new myth about President Obama and deriding him for lashing out at a pro-Trump protester at a rally on Friday. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Trump said that Mr. Obama was \u201creally screaming\u201d at the protester and that his behavior was a \u201cdisgrace.\u201d \u201cIf I spoke the way Obama spoke to that protester they would say 'he became unhinged,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump declared. On Sunday, Politifact, the fact-checking website, analyzed the tape of Mr. Obama at the rally to determine whether Mr. Trump\u2019s criticism was fair. \u201cObama defended the protester\u2019s right to speak out, and didn\u2019t scream at him,\u201d according to PolitiFact\u2019s Allison Graves. \u201cIn fact, Obama\u2019s remarks were directed at Clinton supporters, not the protester.\u201d Mr. Obama expressed exasperation on Sunday at Mr. Trump\u2019s willingness to deceive his supporters so blatantly about the situation. \u201cHe thought it was ok to just lie in front of all of his supporters,\u201d Mr. Obama said at a rally for Mrs. Clinton in Florida. \u201cWasn\u2019t even trying to be sneaky about it.\u201d In the final push, Clinton looked to Khan and LeBron. Mrs. Clinton has campaigned with a powerhouse lineup of supporters over the past week, and two people joined her on Sunday are among the most potent. In Ohio, she appeared alongside LeBron James, the Cleveland Cavaliers star and a revered figure in the biggest swing state leaning toward Mr. Trump. In New Hampshire, Mrs. Clinton was joined by an electrifying figure of a different kind: Khizr Khan, whose August clash with Mr. Trump proved disastrous for the Republican nominee. On Sunday, he discussed supportive stories people have shared with him and his wife, Ghazala Khan, after Mr. Trump attacked them following his conventionremarks.",
