Lady Gaga staged a protest against Trump outside Trump Tower, clinging to a sanitation truck with a sign 'Love Trumps Hate'. She was then pictured looking emotional in a luxury black Rolls-Royce Phantom being driven away clasping her hands together. At midnight, she had taken to Twitter and wrote: 'Say a prayer America.' Just hours before Trump cinched his victory, Demi Lovato was forced to apologize for making an insensitive election joke. The singer, a vocal Clinton supporter, tweeted yesterday: 'Sometimes you just have to agree to disagree and grab some p***y', referring to Donald Trump's notorious lewd comments in leaked Access Hollywood tapes. Scroll down for video Lady Gaga waves a poster saying 'Love Trumps Hate' in protest as she clings onto a New York City sanitation truck in the early hours of Wednesday  Gaga later posted the photo of her outside Trump Tower on Instagram Lady Gaga was pictured looking depondent in a black Rolls-Royce Phantom after staging a protest with a sanitation truck outside Trump tower Lovato swiftly deleted the tweet after facing backlash from her fans and by 5pm yesterday, she issued an apology saying she was just trying to make 'light of the election.'

Canada took to Twitter to welcome them, writing that immigrants are 'encouraged to bring their cultural traditions with them and share them with their fellow citizens.'
