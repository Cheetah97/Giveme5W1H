Massa\u2019s Williams car crashed in lap 48 as the Brazilian struggled to cope with the endless downpour on his home track of Interlagos. AP:Associated Press 5 Felipe Massa waves to the crowd of adoring fans after the race Getty Images 5 The Brazilian is retiring from F1 at the end of the season and raced for the last time at Interlagos Getty Images 5 Massa sits down whilst the race was suspended due to heavy rain Massa escaped the circuit and the weather to huge cheers from the crowd as it finally hit home that one of greats of F1 is about to retire. The Brazilian fought back tears as he was overwhelmed by the emotion coming from his home crowd. Massa said: \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to explain the feeling. To not manage to finish the race, for my fans, for Brazil. \u201cThis place is so special for me but God knows what to do. \u201cIt\u2019s so special from the people in Brazil, in the paddock, everyone that I work for. \u201cI just say thank you very much. It\u2019s a real honour, a real pleasure. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to explain. related articles Gunning for glory How can Nico Rosberg can be crowned as Formula One world champion this weekend?

All these people, all you guys will be in my heart forever.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t deserve so much like that. \u201cI could have finished the race, but maybe it was better like that.\u201d Getty Images 5 Massa cries as he heads down the pit lane Getty Images 5 The Williams driver is given a guard of honour by his rival teams The pits were united in showing their appreciation as all the crews paid homage to a sporting great who has given everything to the sport he loves dearly. Massa was given a guard of honour as he walked to meet his wife Anna Raffaella and son Felipinho whom he hugged, kissed and sobbed. Lewis Hamilton eventually won a very dangerous Grand Prix that saw a number of cars aquaplaning across the track with the worry that life threatening accidents could be on the verge of unfolding if the weather was to continue to get worse. Fortunately there were no serious injuries amongst the crashes and the debris as the championship is still left hanging in the balance.
