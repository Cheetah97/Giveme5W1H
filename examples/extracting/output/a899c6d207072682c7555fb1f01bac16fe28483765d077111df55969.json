  "text": "Hillary Clinton has opened the battle wounds incurred by her and her supporters by blaming her defeat by Donald Trump on FBI Director James Comey's decision to reopen the probe into her use of a private email server. In comments to donors on Saturday, an interaction that was essentially a farewell conference call, she blamed the renewed FBI inquiry into her State Department email system for blunting her momentum in the presidential election. She also said the closure of that inquiry just two days before election day energised voters for in favour of the New York tycoon. Hillary Clinton's campaign respond after FBI gives her the all clear \u201cThere are lots of reasons why an election like this is not successful,\u201d she said, according to the Washington Post. \u201cBut our analysis is that [FBI Director James ] Comey\u2019s letter raising doubts that were groundless, baseless, proven to be, stopped our momentum.\" She added: \u201cWe dropped, and we had to keep really pushing ahead to regain our advantage \u2014 which going into the last weekend, we had. \u201cWe were once again up in all but two of the battleground states, and we were up considerably in some that we ended up losing. And we were feeling like we had put it back together.\u201d The Post said that Ms Clinton said the surprise announcement that the case was being reopened came at a time when the campaign was riding high. \u201cAfter the third debate, we felt so good about where we were,\u201d she said. She said Mr Trump\u2019s performance in the final debate was widely condemned. \u201cWe were up considerably in all but two of the battleground states where we were tied or one behind, according to our data,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were tied in Arizona. We just had a real wind at our back,\u201d before the first, stunning letter from Mr Comey.",
