  "text": "Hillary Clinton has reportedly blamed two letters to Congress by FBI director James Comey for her defeat by Donald Trump in the US presidential election. Politico was first to report that Clinton made the comments on Saturday, in a call with donors who gave more than $100,000 to her campaign. Clinton\u2019s presidential run ended with a narrow victory in the popular vote but defeat \u2013 by 290 votes to 228, with Michigan and New Hampshire yet to declare \u2013 in the electoral college that decides the presidency. An individual who was on the donors\u2019 call, Politico reported, claimed Clinton said the first letter prompted a fall in favourable polling but there was a rebound before the second letter \u201cawakened Donald Trump\u2019s voters\u201d. The New York Times quoted a donor as saying Clinton said: \u201cThere are lots of reasons why an election like this is not successful \u2026 our analysis is that Comey\u2019s letter raising doubts that were groundless, baseless, proven to be, stopped our momentum.\u201d The comments, which were similar to reported remarks by other campaign sources, contrasted with anger from Javier Palomarez, president and chief executive of the US Hispanic Chamber of Commerce (USHCC). He told the Guardian on Saturday it was Clinton\u2019s neglect of Latino voters that handed the presidency to Trump. Comey made headlines on 28 October with his first letter, 11 days before the vote. In the letter, he told members of Congress that new emails had been discovered that could be relevant to a completed investigation into Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while secretary of state. The original investigation had ended in July with no charge against Clinton, who Comey said had been \u201cextremely careless\u201d in her conduct, but not to the extent of criminal or intentional wrongdoing. The new emails were discovered, it was reported, on a device belonging to Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of Clinton aide Huma Abedin, during an investigation into Weiner for for allegedly exchanging lewd messages with a minor. Republicans responded with bafflement at Comey\u2019s break with policy and decades of precedent, and furious senior Democrats suggested the FBI director may have violated the Hatch Act, a federal statute that bars political activity by senior officials. Comey\u2019s second letter was sent last Sunday, two days before the election. In it, he said a review of the newly discovered emails had been completed, and that it found no evidence to merit reopening the investigation of Clinton. Republicans, including Trump, responded angrily, alleging that the review could not have been completed correctly in so short a time. Reports said 650,000 emails were in question, although that number was not officially confirmed. Saturday\u2019s reported remarks mirrored comments, previously reported by Politico, in an email from Navin Nayak, Clinton\u2019s head of opinion research. \u201cWe believe that we lost this election in the last week,\u201d the magazine reported Nayak as writing on Thursday. \u201cComey\u2019s letter in the last 11 days of the election both helped depress our turnout and also drove away some of our critical support among college-educated white voters \u2013 particularly in the suburbs. \u201cWe also think Comey\u2019s [second] letter, which was intended to absolve [Secretary] Clinton, actually helped to bolster Trump\u2019s turnout.\u201d Resistance and anger: progressives urge Democratic party to stand up and fight Read more Clinton did not speak on election night, instead delivering a concession speech at a hotel in New York on Wednesday. In excerpts from an interview to be broadcast by CBS on Sunday, Trump discussed the call he took from his Democratic opponent in the small hours of that morning. \u201cSo Hillary called and it was a lovely call,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cShe couldn\u2019t have been nicer. She just said, \u2018Congratulations, Donald, well done.\u2019 And I said, \u2018I want to thank you very much, you were a great competitor.\u2019\u201d Politico\u2019s source said Clinton seemed \u201csad but hopeful\u201d on the donors call, as she discussed the importance to Democrats of political engagement in the future. In a speech to the AFL-CIO on Thursday, the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren attributed Clinton\u2019s defeat to a failed economic message, saying: \u201cThe final results may have divided us but the entire electorate embraced deep, fundamental reform of our economic system and our political system.\u201d Palomarez, head of an organisation which represents 4.2m Hispanic-owned businesses, blamed Clinton\u2019s failure on a lack of engagement with Latino voters. He told the Guardian: \u201cWe thought this election cycle would be different. Unfortunately, Hillary Clinton was advised once again by Beltway advisers who knew it all, had the models and the projections, but who called it wrong.\u201d",
