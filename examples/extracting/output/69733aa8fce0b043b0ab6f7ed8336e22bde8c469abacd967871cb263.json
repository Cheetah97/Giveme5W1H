  "text": "Police investigating the Croydon tram crash have named the final three victims as Donald Collett, Philip Logan and Robert Huxley. A total of six men and one woman died in the crash when the tram overturned as it entered a bend at high speed. The family of Mr Collett, 62, from Croydon, said he could 'light up a room with his smile'. A statement read: 'Don was a well loved, funny and generous man, who could light up a room with his smile. He is tragically leaving behind a loving family, partner, adored friends and work colleagues. 'Please rest in peace and know you are truly loved and greatly missed.' Mr Logan's family said he was a 'true family man' and a 'generous friend'. A statement from the family read: ' Philip Logan known to all who knew him as Loag, a loving husband to Marilyn, brother to Susan, father to Lee, Tracy, Lisa and Adele, grandfather and great grandfather. 'He was a true family man and generous friend to all with a magnificently dry sense of humor. 'Phil was a man with more love compassion and zest for life than words can express. He will be immensely missed by all that knew him.' The tram's driver was arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and quizzed by investigators who revealed the vehicle was travelling 'significantly' above the permitted speed. He was later released on bail. Scroll down for video Donald Collett, 62, of Croydon (left); and Philip Logan, 52, from New Addington, South London, who died in the crash Dane Chinnery (pictured left), Mark Smith (centre left), Phil Seary (centre right) and Dorota Rynkiewicz (far right) all died in the Croydon tram crash Rail workers at the site work to fix the track where the tram derailed on Wednesday which saw seven people killed Repair work continues on the section of track where a tram crashed, killing seven people, in Croydon, south London Floral tributes left for victim Mark Smith near the Sandilands tram stop by the site of the Croydon tram crash British Transport Police said Donald Collett, 62, of Croydon; Philip Logan, 52, and Robert Huxley, 63, both of New Addington, died in the accident when the tram overturned A resident observes the flowers left near the tram stop where seven people were killed on Wednesday People lay flowers at the scene where the tram crash - six men and one woman died in the crash A Crystal Palace shirt for fans Dane Chinnery and Phil Seary are laid in memory of the pair who died in the crash Floral tributes and Crystal Palace flags and shirts are laid near the scene where a tram crash on Wednesday There was a march for the victims, with many wearing Crystal Palace colours (pictured in the tribute) A group of up to 100 people on Saturday marched down the road carrying banners, flags and flowers to the spot where hundreds of bouquets had already been laid for the victims of the derailing in south London. People spilled out onto the road as they hugged each other and looked at the tributes that had been laid near to the site where the tram crashed during the morning commute on Wednesday. The tram has been removed and repair work on the track has started. An operation to remove the 100 feet-long articulated tram began late last night, with the sections craned onto a flatbed lorry earlier on Saturday. Among the dead were a mother with two young children, a new father, a teenager and a grandfather on his way to work after swapping shifts. Many in Saturday's march were wearing Crystal Palace football colours while some of the bouquets laid were red and blue to reflect the team's colours. Two of the victims - 19-year-old Dane Chinnery and Philip Seary, 57 - were fanatical fans of the club. Friends and family clapped for one minute as they thought about those who had lost their lives in the derailment, ending by singing, 'They're one of our own'. It comes as police revealed they have launched an investigation into claims another tram almost derailed the week before. The tram which crashed in Croydon killing seven people was removed from the scene this morning The tram is taken away from the scene on Saturday as a police probe claimed another almost derailed the week before Investigators said the tram was going significantly faster than the 12mph speed limit as it took a sharp corner The only woman victim, Dorota Rynkiewicz, 35, who had two young daughters, was described by friends as a devoted mother and a 'friendly, caring and giving person'. Her husband Andrzej, a professional golfer, was too upset to talk at the family home in New Addington, Croydon. The couple had moved to the UK from Poland 10 years ago for a 'better life'. Colleagues who started a crowdfunding page to raise \u00a35,000 for her family said Ms Rynkiewicz was 'loved by many people'. Mother-of-two Dorota Rynkiewicz, pictured with golfer husband Andrzej, was described by friends as a devoted mother and a 'friendly, caring and giving person' Tributes have also been paid online to young father Mark Smith, pictured with fiancee Indre Novikovaite and son Lucas, described as someone who 'could always make anyone laugh' Mr Smith, left with Miss Novikovaite and right with son Lucas, was described as a keen fisherman by friends on social media Another victim was named by police as Mark Smith, 35, from Croydon, who had an 18-month old son with his fiancee Indra Novikovaite and the couple planned to marry next year. The couple had been going out for four years. Her brother said: 'My sister is completely devastated by this.' His cousin, Tom Smith, said: 'Still cannot believe this is true, the last couple of days have just felt like a nightmare. 'The thought that we are all never gonna see you or hear from you again makes me feel sick. We are all in bits.' Mr Smith was on his way to work as a glazier when the speeding tram careered off the tracks and flipped over. Phil Seary (left) pictured at the wedding of his youngest daughter Karina who married Darren Mimms Mr Seary's son-in-law revealed he had only been on the tram on Wednesday morning after agreeing to cover a colleague's shift at his job as an electrical engineer at the Royal Opera House, because he was 'such a kind man' Tributes poured in for Dane Chinnery, left and right with his mother Beverley, a 19-year-old Crystal Palace fan who was killed in the tram crash in Croydon The family of Royal Opera House worker Phil Seary, 57, described him as a 'much loved wonderful son, faithful husband, a loving and doting father and a gentle giant grandfather'. They added: 'He will be immensely missed by all that had the great fortune to know him.' Mr Seary's son-in-law Darren Mimms said he was on his way to work to cover a shift. He said: 'As Phil was such a kind man he would do anything to help anybody. It's really hurting his wife Ann. He shouldn't have been on that tram. He found out the day before he had to go into work that day. 'If he hadn't have been at work he would have been doing bits and bobs around the house and looking after his granddaughter. Ann's not blaming anybody. 'Ann is really hoping to wake up from this horrible dream. She was planning to retire next year. She has worked as a teaching assistant at Rowdown Primary School for 27 years. 'They were hoping to go travelling. Being American she wanted to see more of Europe and that was their plan. We are in complete devastated shock.' Crystal Palace supporter Mr Seary, also known as 'Tank', had three daughters Martha, 43, Erica, 31, Karina, 29, four grandchildren, four great grandchildren and another on the way. Dane Chinnery, a 19-year-old Crystal Palace fan described as a 'friendly, genuine lad', was the first victim to be identified following the crash. Rail workers begin recovery work on the tram rail lines junction at the site of the Croydon tram crash Floral tributes left near the Sandilands tram stop as police probe claims another almost derailed near the location last week The damaged tram carriage was wrapped in tarpaulin last night and removed from the scene on Friday morning Investigators said they expect an interim report on the disaster to be released next week Recovery workers at the site of the crash. The wrecked carriages were covered in blue tarpaulin before they were taken away Firefighters lowered their heads as a mark of respect towards those killed and injured in Wednesday's crash Members of the Armed Forces and emergency services joined the Royal British Legion for the remembrance ceremony Forensic teams and accident investigators have been sweeping the scene for much of the past 48 hours as they try to establish the exact cause of the crash The driver of the tram, a 42-year-old man from Beckenham, was released on bail after being arrested on Wednesday on suspicion of manslaughter over the crash. It occurred at around 6.10am on Tuesday on a sharp bend near the Sandilands stop as the vehicle travelled from New Addington to Wimbledon. Investigators said the tram was travelling at a 'significantly higher speed' than the 12mph speed limit and are probing whether the driver had fallen asleep or was on his phone. Detectives are also examining a report that a tram 'lifted onto one side' at 40mph in the same area on October 31. BTP said the claim 'will now form one of our lines of inquiry'. And commuter Andy Smith said last summer he wrote to Transport for London to complain after the tram he was travelling on approached the same corner too fast. He said: 'I felt that the train was going to derail because the speed was so fast I didn't think we were going to make the left-hand turn. I knew this was coming.' Survivors of the disaster told how they heard 'crying and screaming' after the carriages hit the ground, pictured The incident occurred near Sandilands tram stop in Croydon, south London, pictured, on a steep bend The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) has launched a witness appeal, with anyone who was on the tram or has information relevant to the accident being asked to complete an incident form on the organisation's website. An interim report into what happened will be published by the RAIB next week, with a final report, including any safety recommendations, coming at the conclusion of the investigation. On Friday an extra minute's silence was held to remember the victims during the town's Armistice Day ceremony. Croydon MP Gavin Barwell spoke to relatives near the scene where floral tributes and football scarves have been placed. Authorities are still working on formally identifying the victims, Mr Barwell said. He said: 'It's quite right that the authorities absolutely want to make sure when they give a formal identification that they've got that 100 per cent right. Injured passengers were taken to St George's Hospital in south west London and Croydon University Hospital. Some of the 20 survivors at St George's had limbs amputated. One passenger suffered a collapsed lung. Personal injury expects said claims arising from the tram crash could reach millions of pounds. TRAM PASSENGER CLAIMS CARRIAGE 'LIFTED ONTO ONE SIDE' ON SAME STRETCH OF TRACK LAST WEEK Andy Nias posted this message on Facebook earlier following the fatal Croydon crash. He claimed he was on a tram which 'lifted onto one side' last week on the same stretch of track A passenger on a tram travelling on the same stretch of track last week, told how he was left shaken after he claimed it 'lifted onto one side'. Andy Nias wrote on Facebook that he and 29 fellow travellers feared the worst when their tram 'took the hard corner to Sandilands at 40mph'. He said on October 31: 'Oh mate...30 of us on the tram this morning and we all thought our time was up...tram driver took the hard corner to Sandilands at 40mph!! 'I swear the tram lifted onto one side. Everyone still shaking...it's mad.' Locals have raised concerns about the speeds trams can travel at the corner where the carriages derailed. Pat Rooke, 72, a nearby resident, said 'They (some trams) do come around that corner very fast sometimes, and it is quite a sharp bend.' Sue Patel, who lives near the station, added: 'I heard a noise at around 6 o'clock and I thought maybe it was a car or something. But then I saw there were helicopters.' 'There's quite a big bend. You come through the tunnel and there's quite a sharp bend.' In February 2012 a tram, carrying 100 passengers, also derailed on the line but no one was hurt. The accident happened about half a mile from today's fatal crash.",
