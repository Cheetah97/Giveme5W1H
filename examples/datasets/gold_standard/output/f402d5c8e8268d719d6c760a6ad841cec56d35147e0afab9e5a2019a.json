  "text": "A family member of a Chinese boy, who is thought to have fallen down a deep well, said the well turned out to be empty, according to Chinese media. Some 80 diggers have been dispatched to the village in central China to save the five-year-old after his family claimed he had plummeted into a 130-foot-deep chute last week. The team of rescuers have been searching for the child for more than 85 hours as of writing. Where is the boy? Rescuers have worked around the clock for more than three days Five-year-old Zhao Sicong, from China, fell into a deserted well on Sunday, his family claimed After the family alerted the authority, a large team of rescuers have been sent to save the child Rescue operation has been going on for more than 85 hours around the clock as of writing However, the child's uncle told a reporter that he found the well to be empty this morning The boy's uncle, Song Jiandang, told a reporter from The Paper that he only saw a pile of dry mud at the bottom of the well as he carried out excavations this morning in the village of Zhongmengchang in Lixian County, Hebei's Baoding city. Mr Song said he was digging the earth with another family member and one volunteer from the same village. The uncle said they dug from 5am for about two hours. The boy's uncle said he only saw a pile of dry mud at the bottom of the well when he peeked The man said he was about 13 feet from the bottom of the well and he looked down the well The man was puzzled when he saw nobody in the well and he had no idea where the boy was As they were about four metres (13 feet) from the bottom of the well, the boy's uncle turned on a torch and looked down the well. Surprisingly, he found nobody there. A puzzled Mr Song also claimed that the rescuers had used life detectors for four or five times during the operation, and they couldn't find any signs of life either. The excavation is still ongoing as of writing. Excavators work at the rescue site in Zhongmengchang Village of Lixian County in Baoding The rescue team are trying to save a boy who fell into a dried well in Baoding on November 6 A six-year-old boy fell into a deserted well measuring 130ft deep and 12 inches wide A large rescue team, including police, firemen and paramedics, have been sent to the scene According to the boy's parents and grandfather, the child, named Zhao Zicong by Chinese media, fell into the deserted well by accident while harvesting cabbages with his father at around 11am on November 6. The boy had previously been reported to be six years old, but more updated reports said he was five years old. The dry well measured 30 centimetres wide (11.8 inches). The boy's grandfather told a reporter from The Beijing News on an earlier occasion that the well was located near their house and had been used to irrigate the nearby fields. The man also said that the well was about 40 metres deep (131 feet) and had been abandoned for around five years. After the family alerted the local authority, a team of rescuers, including police officers, firefighters, paramedics and local volunteers were sent to the scene to search for the boy. Over 80 diggers have been dispatched for the rescue operation, according to local media The heavy duty vehicles are working around the clock to save the child since fell on Sunday The heavy-duty vehicles have dug a crater of around 330 feet in diametre around the well It remains unknown whether or not Zhao is still alive as rescuers carry on searching More than 80 diggers have been sent to the farm to remove earth around the well, according to local media. Rescuers have put metal tubes around the well to prevent the boy from being hurt by the diggers. In addition, oxygen is being pumped into the bottom of the well by the rescuers.
