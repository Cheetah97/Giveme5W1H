Addressing the mourners one man said: \"I've got a huge hole in my life which I've got to fill in, and it's going to take to the day I die.\" Floral tributes: A bank of bouquets at the scene (PA) Six men and one woman died and more than 50 people were injured when the carriages flipped over as the tram turned around a sharp bend at around 6.10am near the Sandilands stop while travelling from New Addington to Wimbledon. The tram's driver was arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and questioned by investigators who have said the vehicle was travelling \"significantly\" above the permitted speed. The 42-year-old man from Beckenham was released on bail, and investigators are probing whether the driver had fallen asleep. An online fundraising page set up by Croydon Council to enable \"ongoing care and support\" to those directly affected by the crash has raised more then PS8,000.",
