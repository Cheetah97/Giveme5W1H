The tension was palpable as Obama praised Trump saying he was \"encouraged\" by the divisive billionaire's interest in working with his team during their \"wide-ranging\" chat. EPA 18 Trump shares a cringe-worthy handshake with President Obama AP:Associated Press 18 The power couple met for the first time in the iconic Oval office Reuters 18 You're fired....the brash billionaire points his finger at Obama as the two share a laugh AP:Associated Press 18 The former Apprentice host is pictured making a point in his usual animated fashion President Obama and President-elect Trump meet at the White House And the former Apprentice host spoke glowingly about his 90 minute meeting with the Democratic President calling it \"a great honour\" - despite repeatedly questioning Obama's place of birth over his eight year stint as Commander in Chief. He said: \"We had never met. The meeting was supposed to last 10 minutes, I have great respect (for him), it went on for an hour-and-a-half and as far as I'm concerned it could have gone on longer. \"We really we discussed a lot of different situations, some wonderful and some difficulties. related stories STREET BEATING Donald Trump supporters 'leave gay man covered in blood in shocking street attack' HE'S GONE SOFT!

He said he \"encouraged\" by Trump's desire to \"work with my team around many of the issues that this great country faces\". 'WILLY-WAVING' Body language expert Judi James gives her analysis of the historic meeting We shouldn't be fooled by the superficial mirroring and wan smiles, this meeting between Trump and Obama was a clash of the alphas, and the body position known as 'willy-waving' confirms that. - Both men sat well beyond the social distance apart with their legs at full splay, which is a ritual of superiority that is more about machismo than intellect or job titles. It showed a very basic animosity below what looked like a desire to signal a relaxed and casual meet-up. Trump's steepled hands added to this air of competitive masculinity and he even tapped his fingers together with a look of impatience to get on with the job. - There was some weak joking towards the end, then Trump turned Obama's dismissive offer of a stretched hand to shake into a much more enthusiastic gesture by grabbing the hand and pumping it warmly. - The eye expressions and lack of mutual eye contact probably said it all though. Trump is having his waxwork made for Tussauds but it looked from the dead eye expressions as though both men had used their wax dummies as body double stand-ins for the meeting. He added: \"And I believe that it is important for all of us, regardless of party and regardless of political preferences, to now come together, work together, to deal with the many challenges that we face.\" The Democrat said that his wife First Lady Michelle Obama had spent some time with Trump's wife Melania and revealed his family wanted them to feel welcome in the White House.

After lunch, Trump and vice-president elect Mike Pence had a meeting with US Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Trump flew from New York on his private jet today and landed at Reagan National Airport, just outside the capital. Trump's motorcade took a South Lawn entrance into the White House, out of view of television cameras.

Getty Images 18 Mitch McConnell (centre) smiles as he walks with President-elect Donald Trump with his wife Melania and Vice President-elect Mike Pence Previously, Trump championed the so-called \"Birther movement\", challenging that Obama was actually born in the US. Democrat Obama in turn has described the celebrity businessman as \"uniquely unqualified\" to be president. White House chief of staff Denis McDonough was seen taking a walk around the South Lawn driveway with Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner. A handful of other Trump aides trailed behind McDonough and Kushner, who is married to Trump's daughter Ivanka and was one of his closest advisers during the campaign.
