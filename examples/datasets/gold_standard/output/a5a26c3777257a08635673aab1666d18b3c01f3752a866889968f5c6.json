Eventually the cars were allowed to race with wet tires equipped but drivers struggled with spray and standing water on the track. Raikkonen lost control of his Ferrari on the home straight and careered across the track with Verstappen coming within millimetres of a disastrous collision. 2016 Formula One cars ranked Tue, March 22, 2016 Express Sport ranks the new F1 cars for the 2016 season Play slideshow Getty Images 1 of 11 11.
