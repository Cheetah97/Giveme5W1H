To not manage to finish the race, for my fans, for Brazil. \"This place is so special for me but God knows what to do. \"It's so special from the people in Brazil, in the paddock, everyone that I work for. \"I just say thank you very much.

Lewis Hamilton eventually won a very dangerous Grand Prix that saw a number of cars aquaplaning across the track with the worry that life threatening accidents could be on the verge of unfolding if the weather was to continue to get worse.
