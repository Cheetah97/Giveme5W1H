  "text": "A gunman opened fire in downtown Seattle on Wednesday night following an argument and wounded five people not far from protests over the surprise victory of Republican Donald Trump in the U.S. presidential election. The shooting did not appear to be related to the anti-Trump demonstrations but instead stemmed from 'some type of personal argument', Robert Merner, assistant chief of the Seattle Police Department, told reporters. 'It appears that some type of argument took place. This individual began to walk away from the crowd, then turned and fired into the crowd,' Merner said. He said the suspect then fled from the area on foot and remained at large. A gunman opened fire in downtown Seattle on Wednesday night following an argument and wounded five people not far from protests over the surprise victory of Republican Donald Trump Medics respond to a multiple victim shooting near Third Avenue and Pike Street in Seattle The shooting did not appear to be related to the anti-Trump demonstrations but instead stemmed from 'some type of personal argument', Robert Merner, assistant chief of the Seattle Police Department, said Police and fire crews were on the scene in less than a minute because they had been in the area to monitor the demonstrations, he said, but did not arrive in time to engage the suspect. Police closed down the intersection of Third Avenue and Pine streets, where the shooting took place in front of a 7-11 convenience store. 7-11 manager Sharon Keith told reporters she heard what sounded like firecrackers and told everyone to get down. Keith says she was inside the store Wednesday evening and could see multiple people on the ground outside afterward. 'How do you describe that, there were multiple people down, a lot of blood,' she said. Authorities say a man escaped on foot after firing into a crowd and wounding five people outside a convenience store Sharon Keith, center-left, who works at the 7-11 near where the shooting occurred, cries as she talks to reporters about the shooting Harborview Medical Center spokeswoman Susan Gregg says the condition of several people wounded by gunfire in downtown Seattle has improved from serious to satisfactory condition. Gregg says one woman and two men shot when a gunman opened fire Wednesday evening were improving at the hospital Wednesday night. She says two other men remain in critical, but stable condition in intensive care. The five victims range in age from 20s to 50s and sustained injuries to their legs, chest and neck. Police were still searching for a male gunman.
