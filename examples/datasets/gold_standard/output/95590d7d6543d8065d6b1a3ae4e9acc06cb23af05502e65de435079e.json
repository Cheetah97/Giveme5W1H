  "description": "FBI Director James Comey delivered his second shock to the presidential campaign Sunday by announcing that there would not be any charges involving the newly found e-mails tied to Hillary Clinton.\n\n\n\nIn a letter sent to congressional leaders two days before Tuesday's election, Comey said his agents had \"been working around-the-clock to process and review [the] large volume of e-mails,\" the discovery of which he revealed just nine days earlier\n\n\n\n\"During that process, we reviewed all of the communications that were to or from Hillary Clinton while she was secretary of state,\" he wrote.\n\n\n\n\"Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton,\" said Comey, who in July called her handling of the e-mails \"extremely careless'' but not criminal at the time.\n\n\n\nDonald Trump has surged in the polls since Comey's Oct. 28 revelation of the new e-mails, many of which were believed to have been sent to or from Clinton's private server while she was secretary of state.\n\n\n\nThe Republican candidate hailed Comey's original letter about the newly found e-mails -- but yesterday, he blasted the FBI chief, saying he did not do a thorough enough probe.\n\n\n\n\"Right now, she is being protected by a rigged system,\" Trump told a raucous crowd in a suburb of Detroit.\n\n\n\n\"You can't review 650,000 new e-mails in eight days. You can't do it, folks. Hillary Clinton is guilty. She knows it.
