Javits Convention Center in New York City pleading for last-minute voters to vote Clinton Lady Gaga shared a picture giving the thumbs up alongside Lena Dunham on Twitter Later on in the evening, the singer was pictured alongside Billie Jean King looking less enthusiastic Mandy Moore and Jessica Chastain were among celebrities expressing their dismay on Twitter 'We are staring into the face of our darkest self America. Why does it have to have a dyed combover??' joked Connie Britton. Earlier in the evening, Perry addressed the audience at Clinton's election night party at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York City. She pleaded with voters in states that had not closed off their ballot boxes to rush out and vote for Clinton as the results went south for the White House hopeful. 'First and foremost if, you are in a state, and you're watching this and your polls are still open, you must vote for Hillary Clinton tonight!' she begged. Perry said that her Republican parents voted for Trump. Her parents Keith Hudson and Mary Perry are born again Christians and the singer has previously spoken of her strict upbringing. 'But you know what, we will still all be sitting at the same table for Thanksgiving,' she added. 'And this is the moment we need to remember that we all love our parents, and we all love our children. Hollywood began to panic on Twitter that the election results weren't going the Democratic nominee's way The Rolling Stones previously told Trump to stop playing their songs during his campaign. But that didn't stop him playing 'You Can't Always Get What You Want' after his victory speech. Now Mick Jagger has made him an offer... Nigella Lawson said that the results of the US election came down to 'racism' and that 'confederate flags will be flying' Lord Sugar commented on his The Apprentice counterpart's victory, saying 'the markets are stable' Canada took to Twitter to welcome immigrants, saying they are 'encouraged to bring their cultural traditions with them and share them with their fellow citizens' Miley Cyrus broke down in tears in a video posted on Twitter as she talked about the election results 'And I can rest easy knowing that both of my young nieces at home will never see themselves less than equal - anything other than equal.' The pop star has performed for Clinton at several rallies in the past year, including one on Saturday night in Philadelphia. But she did not soothe nervous Clinton supporters gathered outside the Javits Convention Center in New York City tonight with a song. Instead, she read aloud from a piece paper she brought with her to the stage. A victory for Clinton tonight 'will be proof that America is great,' Perry proclaimed. CELEBRITIES WHO PLEDGED TO LEAVE IF TRUMP WON LENA DUNHAM The Girls star said she'd move to Canada if Trump won the presidency. 'I love Canada. I think that it's a great place, and there's an area in Vancouver that I find beautiful and appealing, and I can conduct business from there,' she said. BARBRA STREISAND Streisand suggested she would move to Australia or Canada if Trump emerged the victor on Election Day. 'I can't believe it. I'm either coming to your country if you'll let me in, or Canada,' the singer told 60 Minutes in August. AMY SCHUMER Comedian and actress Amy Schumer said she would head for Spain if Trump won. 'My act will change because I will need to learn to speak Spanish because I will move to Spain or somewhere,' she told BBC's Newsnight. 'It's beyond my comprehension if Trump won. It's just too crazy.' SAMUEL L. JACKSON 'If that motherf***** becomes president, I'm moving my black a** to South Africa,' the actor said on Jimmy Kimmel. CHELSEA HANDLER The talk show host revealed she had already bought a house in another county just in case Trump won. 'I did buy a house in another country just in case,' Handler said in an interview on ABC's Live with Kelly and Michael in May. 'So all these people that threaten to leave the country and then don't - I actually will leave that country.' BRYAN CRANSTON The Breaking Bad actor said he would 'definitely' move if Trump won, suggesting a permanent vacation to Vancouver. 'I would definitely move. It's not real to me that that would happen. I hope to God it won't,' Cranston said in October. JON STEWART Stewart told People magazine that he would think about 'getting in a rocket and going to another planet because clearly this planet's gone bonkers.' CHER Singer Cher has a similar idea. 'IF HE WERE TO BE ELECTED, I'M MOVING TO JUPITER,' she said on Twitter last year. REV AL SHARPTON The civil rights activist told the audience at a Center for American Progress event in February that he would be looking for flights if Trump won. 'I'm also reserving my ticket to get out of here if he wins. Only because he'd probably have me deported anyhow,' Sharpton said. MILEY CYRUS The singer called Trump a 'f****** nightmare' and pledge to leave the US if he won in a couple of Instagram posts.
