At a rally in the Detroit suburbs, Trump repeated his claims that a shadowy conspiracy is working to foil his bid to become president, telling supporters it would have been impossible for the FBI to go through as many as 650,000 emails in a short space of time. EPA 9 Trump is furious after the FBI announced his Democratic rival had no case to answer over her emails AP:Associated Press 9 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton gestures as she takes the stage during a campaign rally Sunday \"Right now she's being protected by a rigged system. It's a totally rigged system.
