During the campaign, Mr Obama called Mr Trump \"uniquely unqualified\". How did America vote? A breakdown by race and gender However, following Hillary Clinton's concession speech, Mr Obama told supporters he was \"rooting for Donald Trump's success\". Speaking after the 90-minute meeting, Mr Obama said: \"My number one priority in the coming two months is to try to facilitate a transition that ensures our President-elect is successful.\" He said they had discussed domestic and foreign policy and he had been \"very encouraged\" by Mr Trump's interest in working with President Obama's team. Mr Trump said he would \"very much look forward\" to dealing with President Obama in future. Thousands of protestors marched on Trump Tower on Wednesday night in protest against the billionaire businessman's victory.
