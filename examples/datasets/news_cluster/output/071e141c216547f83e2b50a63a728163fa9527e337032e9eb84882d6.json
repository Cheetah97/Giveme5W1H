Over 50 people were taken to hospital.\nA Met spokesman said: \"Police were called to an overturned tram at 6.10 and officers are in attendance.\"\nHannah Collier, who lives nearby the tram station, said: \"Heard a massive crash outside my window, now emergency services everywhere for the overturned tram, hope everyone is ok.\"\nThe 23-year-old added that she had seen people being carried away on stretchers from the scene of the incident.\nJames Long, who lives metres away from the scene of the incident, told the Standard: \"It happened on a sharp bend on the approach to Sandilands tram stop.\n\"I've never seen so many emergency services attend a scene.\"\nA London Fire Brigade spokesman said they had been called at 6.04am to an overturned tram in a tunnel.\n\"There are eight fire engines and four fire and rescue crews in attendance,\" they added.\nPeople are being warned to avoid the tram line and the area surrounding Sandilands station in east Croydon, where there is a large police cordon and many emergency vehicles.\nMiguel John, who was on a bus to Bromley when it stopped by Sandilands tram stop, told the Standard: \"The road hadn't been shut off yet but emergency services were already at the scene, this would have been around 6.30am.\n\u201cBy this point more emergency services were flooding to the scene and a police car shut off the road with vehicles being ushered down Elgin Road towards Addiscombe.\n\u201cBut it was obvious it was very, very serious due to the amount of emergency services at the scene.\n\u201cAt first there would have been roughly between six or 10 [vehicles], as time passed a lot more arrived and continued to arrive.\n\u201cVisibly from where I was about two fire engines, two to three ambulances, several police cars and then more arrived as time went on.\n\u201cI think that\u2019s how everyone knew it was very serious, especially how quickly they acted to shut off the road.\u201d\nA London Ambulance Service spokesman said: \"We were called at 6.13 to an incident at Addiscombe Road in Croydon.\n\"We have sent a number of resources to the scene including ambulance crews, advanced paramedics and single responders in cars.\n\"We are treating a number of patients.\"\nRail safety investigators are reportedly on their way to the scene to begin gathering evidence.\nA British Transport Police spokesman said: \"We are currently on scene at a major incident at Sandilands tram stop in Croydon.\n\"Officers are working to deal with a tram derailment, alongside colleagues from other emergency services.\n\"A number of people are believed to have been injured. People are asked to avoid the area.\"\nMayor of London Sadiq Khan said: \u201cI am in contact with emergency services and TfL, who are working extremely hard to get the situation under control and treat those who have been injured. My thoughts are with all those involved in this incident.\n\u201cWe are asking people to please visit the TfL website, tfl.gov.uk, for the latest travel information.\u201d\nA Transport for London spokesman said: \u201cWe are currently working with the emergency services following a derailment involving a tram in Croydon.\n\u201cThere is currently no service on the tram between Reeves Corner and Addington Village / Harrington Road.\u201d\nToday's is believed to be the first tram crash involving fatalities on board since 1959, when two women passengers and the driver died after a tram caught fire in Glasgow, following a collision with a lorry.\nLondon's only tram network operates in the south of the capital, from Wimbledon to Beckenham Junction, Elmers End and New Addington, via Croydon.\nMore than 27 million passengers used the service in 2015/16.\nThe system uses a combination of on-street and segregated running for the 17 miles (27km) of track.",
