  "text": "Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is author of the book, 'Midnight in the American Empire,' released in 2013. robertvbridge@yahoo.com\nIs it any coincidence that \u2018revelations\u2019 on the so-called \u2018Panama Papers\u2019 \u2013 which purport to expose a money trail leading to the door of President Putin - were served hot to an unsuspecting public between April Fool\u2019s Day and NATO\u2019s 65th birthday?\nJust last week, Moscow sounded the alarm that the West was preparing to launch yet another \u201cinformation attack\u201d against Russia.\nRead more\nWith uncanny accuracy, the proverbial sh*t storm made landfall on Sunday as the German daily S\u00fcddeutschen Zeitung released the leaked documents, touted as the most prodigious dump of data in the history of data dumps.\nFor those who have been able to stomach the ongoing spectacle of Western reporters climbing over themselves to produce the most hyperbolic, fear-mongering drivel on Russia, it should come as no surprise which world leader featured prominently in this latest hatchet job.\nPerhaps The Guardian\u2019s anti-Russia guru Luke Harding deserves the honor of delivering the announcement. Take it away, Luke: \u201cA network of secret offshore deals and vast loans worth $2bn has laid a trail to Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin\u2026 [T]hough the president\u2019s name does not appear in any of the records...\nThat single line of truth in an otherwise convoluted conspiratorial yarn deserves repeating: \u201c\u2026the president\u2019s name does not appear in any of the records.\u201d\nBecause of this inconvenient truth, Harding is forced into a corner with only inconclusive verbs when the moment requires some rock-solid certainty: \u201cThe documents suggest Putin\u2019s family has benefited from this money \u2013 his friends\u2019 fortunes appear his to spend.\u201d\nHere is one of the more creative ways Harding \u2018suggests\u2019 that \u2018Putin\u2019s family\u2019 is somehow connected to the Panama funds: \u201cThe offshore trail starts in Panama, darts through Russia, Switzerland and Cyprus \u2013 and includes a private ski resort where Putin\u2019s younger daughter, Katerina, got married in 2013.\u201d\nNow let that be a warning to anybody who may be considering having their wedding at a ski resort.\nRead more\nAnd then there\u2019s Sergey Roldugin, a professional musician whose apparent crime is being wealthy AND a friend of Putin\u2019s. Apparently Putin is not allowed to have wealthy friends, while any wealthy friend of Putin's is automatically suspect of something, anything.\nHere is Harding again unloading his applecart of inconclusive verbs and adverbs in a desperate attempt to vilify the Russian cellist: \u201cRoldugin has apparently accumulated a fortune \u2013 having been placed in ostensible control of a series of assets worth at least $100m, possibly more.\nWhen Harding is standing in line for his paycheck at The Guardian, I can't help wondering if he says to the clerk: \u2018I would like to suggest that you pay me for an apparent article I allegedly wrote possibly on or around April 3 that alludes to President Putin\u2019s ostensible connections to a cellist friend who may or may not have accumulated a small fortune sometime in the recent past.\u2019\nHere is how one parody website deconstructed the unmistakable Harding masterpieces:\n\"Luke Harding\u2026 has churned out 2 articles totaling over 5,000 words, each using the word 'Putin', almost as often as they use the phrases 'allegedly', 'speculation suggests', 'has been described as' and 'may have been'\".\n\u201cNeither of his articles mentions by name any of the 12 world leaders, past and present, actually identified in the documents, nor do they mention David Cameron\u2019s dad, who is also in there. No, they focus on a cellist friend of Putin\u2019s, talk about his daughter\u2019s marriage, and include an awful lot of diagrams with big arrows that point at pictures of\u2026 Vladimir Putin. This is, apparently, all evidence of\u2026 something.\u201d\nYes. It is certainly evidence of something, and nothing remotely encouraging. It is evidence that we have entered the latest dangerous phase of a concerted media campaign directed against Russia in general and Putin in particular - and just in time for this year\u2019s legislative elections, which the West would certainly like to crash.\nRead more\nSo this brings us to the $2 billion-dollar question: If Putin was not mentioned by name in any of the 11 zillion Panama documents made public by the leaky database of Mossack Fonseca, then why in the world does Putin feature at or near the top in all of the following stories here, here, here and here?\nWhy is the West so obsessed with focusing its narrow attention span on Putin at the exception of corrupt Western leaders who only get passing mention in these hack pieces (incidentally, no American official is mentioned in any media reports regarding the Panama Papers, which is rather odd and certainly implausible since the US \u2013 as the 2008 Financial Crisis readily proved \u2013 has more than its fair share of individuals who double-park their illicit earnings in offshore havens).\nHere\u2019s a big, fat clue: As the Telegraph dutifully reported on Monday, \u201cDavid Cameron\u2019s father ran an offshore fund which avoided paying tax in Britain by hiring Bahamas residents, including a bishop, to sign paperwork.\u201d\n\u201cThe fund, which was established in the 1980s with help from the Prime Minister\u2019s late father, continues today. The Guardian says it has confirmed that \u2018in 30 years Blairmore has never paid a penny of tax in the UK on its profits.\u2019\u201d\nWell now we're getting somewhere.\nWhile it was really swell of the Telegraph and The Guardian to mention Cameron\u2019s father among the Panama revelations, the glorification of David Cameron in these stories \u2013 despite these astounding findings - compared to the vilification of Vladimir Putin is outrageous.\nPublic slams MSM for Putin focus after #Panamapapers leak Posted by RT Play on Monday, April 4, 2016\nAnd like Vladimir Putin, the British Prime Minister \u201cis not named in the reports himself.\u201d However - and here is the notable difference - neither Putin\u2019s father nor any other relative of the Russian president's 'family' is linked to the so-called 'Panama Papers,' aside from dubious connections hatched in the overactive Western imagination\nHowever, as we've already said, Cameron\u2019s late father Ian Cameron, who died in 2010, certainly is.\nSo did the Western media vilify David Cameron for some serious high-ranking connections to this mother of all leaks? No, it did not. Did the Western media publish any damning report that featured Cameron airbrushed alongside global \u2018baddies,\u2019 like former Iranian leader Ahmadinejad? Nope. So why must the Russian president suffer such slanderous abuse?\nIs Putin being used as convenient smokescreen to conceal the real suspects in this story, or is this yet another pathetic attempt to ruin the reputation of the Russian leader, who has navigated his country since 1999 through a menacing sea of global challenges, not least of all NATO forces nudging right up to the Russian border for no good reason whatsoever?\nWhatever the case may be, the plan is backfiring in spectacular fashion, and not least of all because the motivation behind it is so painfully obvious.\nMarcus Papadopulos, editor of the Politics First magazine, explained Western hostility to Putin as symptomatic of his success as a leader in fending off Western ambitions.\n\"Of course, the American and the British governments would like Russia of the 1990\u2019s under [Boris] Yeltsin, when Russia was on its knees, Russia had effectively become a pauper state and was dependent on the IMF [International Monetary Fund],\" Papadopulos told RT.\n\"However, under Putin and his policies all that has been reversed, and we have a very confident Russia domestically \u2013 it still has problems, but it is confident \u2013 and we have a resurgent Russia on the international arena.\n\"For many in Washington and London, that is Putin\u2019s greatest sin \u2013 that Russia is again, as it did in Soviet times... challenging Western global hegemony.\"\nIndeed, more people should take a moment and consider what the world would quickly look like if no challenger is left to balance the US-led NATO countries.",
