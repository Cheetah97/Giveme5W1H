But it could not check the advance of the army and people of the DPRK.\n\"The U.S., styling itself as a superpower while boasting of its strength before other big powers, is in mortal fear of the DPRK.\"\nJapan's defence minister Itsunori Onodera said he believed North Korea has the U.S. territory in mind with its recent nuclear missile tests. as he warned that \"similar actions (by the North) would continue\".\n\"We cannot assume North Korea's intention, but given what it has said, I think it has Guam in mind,\" he said.\nPyongyang has constantly threatened to hit the US Pacific territory - home to the Andersen Air Force Base - with missiles bringing \"enveloping fire\".\nPhysicist David Wright, of the Union of Concerned Scientists, said today: \"North Korea demonstrated that it could reach Guam with this missile, although the payload the missile was carrying is not known\" and its accuracy was in doubt.\"\nThe US Pacific Command confirmed the launch was an intermediate range ballistic missile (IRBM) but insisted it posed no threat to Guam or to the American mainland.\nHowever, officials reiterated that Washington's commitments to the defence of its territories and allies remained \"ironclad\u201d.\nSouth Korea's Defense Ministry said the country's military conducted a live-fire drill of a Hyunmoo-2 ballistic missile in response to the North's latest aggressive move.\nNorth Korean military guard outpost with its national flag, left, is seen in Paju today\nAP:Associated Press North Korea conducted its longest-ever test flight of a ballistic missile on Friday\nKim and his defiant state's act provoked wide-scale condemnation from Western powers as it was announced the UN Security Council would hold an emergency meeting today.\nThe missile flew over northern Japan and smashed down in the Sea of Japan about 2,000km to the east off Hokkaido.\nSeoul said it was the 19th launch of a ballistic missile by North Korea this year.\nSplash News Friday's missile flew over Hokkaido in northern Japan \"at around 07:06 am (2206 GMT) towards the Pacific Ocean\", Japan's J-Alert system said\nSplash News The advert showed a Japanese Self-Defence Force Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) missile launcher in position at the Defence Ministry headquarters in Tokyo\nWarnings sound in Japan after North Korea launches missile from its capital city Pyongang\nThe missile was the second to be sent over Japan by the hermit state in less than a month and the 19th test this year, according to Seoul.\nAfter the launch, the South Korean military also carried out a live tank fire exercise along the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) in Paju.\nSouth Korea\u2019s president has said the country possesses the power to destroy its northern neighbour \u201cbeyond recovery.\"\nMoon Jae-in also said dialogue with the Kim was \u201cimpossible in a situation like this\u201d, South Korea\u2019s Yonhap news agency reported.\nMr Moon said: \u201cIn case North Korea undertakes provocations against us or our ally, we have the power to destroy [them] beyond recovery.\n\u201cDialogue is impossible in a situation like this.

That is now ever more clear.\n\u201cIf North Korea continues to walk this road, there will be no bright future. We need to get North Korea to understand that.\"\nSouth Korea's military says North Korea has fired a missile eastwards from its capital city Pyongang\nGetty Images - Getty South Korean army's K-55 Self-Propelled Artillery participate in a live fire exercise today\nEPA South Korea fears an invasion from its noisy neighbours\nReuters Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga speaks at a news conference about North Korea's missile launch in Tokyo, Japan\nEPA Despot Kim Jong-un threatened to \"sink\" Japan\nBut Mr Suga said there's no evidence of any missile fragments landing on Japanese territory.\nThe US military said the missile did not pose a threat to its territory of Guam.\nU.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis branded North Korea 'reckless' after the launch. Asked about a possible American military response, Mattis said, \"I don't want to talk on that yet.\" after he said that the missile launch had \"put millions of Japanese in duck and cover.\" Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said: \"North Korea has conducted yet another illegal missile launch. \"The UK and the international community have condemned the aggressive and illegal actions of the North Korean regime, and the succession of missile and nuclear tests. \"We stand firmly by Japan and our other international partners. \"We are working to mobilise world opinion with the aim of achieving a diplomatic solution to the situation on the Korean peninsula. \"This week the most stringent UN sanctions regime placed on any nation in the 21st century was imposed on North Korea, after being unanimously agreed at the UN Security Council. \"These measures now need to be robustly enforced. We urge all states to play their part in changing the course North Korea is taking.\"\nAustralian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was also quick to condemn the launch.\n\"This is another dangerous, reckless, criminal act by the North Korean regime, threatening the stability of the region and the world and we condemn it, utterly,\" he said in an interview with Sky News.\n\"This is a sign, I believe, of their frustration at the increased sanctions on North Korea, recently imposed by the Security Council. It's a sign that the sanctions are working.\"\nMr Turnbull later fronted the media, where he addressed whether further sanctions would increase the risk of attack on Japan.\n\"I don't accept that. The critical thing is to continue to apply economic pressure on North Korea to bring the regime to it senses,\" he said.\n\"Nobody wants to see a war on the Korean Peninsula. If Kim Jong-un were to start a war, to attack the United States or one of its allies, he would be signing a suicide note.\nAmerican tourist Matthew Galat woken by sirens after North Korea launches missile\n\"That would be the end for his government and thousands and thousands of people would die. It would be a catastrophe and that is why it is vitally important to maintain this economic pressure on North Korea.\"\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the launch was \"another reckless breach of UN resolutions\" and a \"major threat\" to international peace and security \"which demands a global response.\"\nU.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called on \"all nations to take new measures\" against North Korea after missile launch.\nTillerson added that \"China and Russia must indicate their intolerance for these reckless missile launches by taking direct actions of their own.\"\n\"These continued provocations only deepen North Korea's diplomatic and economic isolation,\" he added.\nAs tensions rise between Donald Trump and North Korea, here's five key things to know about Guam\nChina\u2019s Foreign Ministry said this morning it also opposed North Korea\u2019s use of ballistic missiles in violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions.\nA spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned the launch will cause a spike in regional tensions.\nDmitry Peskov told reporters that Russia \"resolutely condemns\" such moves and said that the missile test will \"lead to the further growth of tensions and the further escalation of tensions on the (Korean) peninsula.\"\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres revealed talks on the crisis would be held on the sidelines of the General Assembly meeting next week.\nGuterres called on the North Korean leadership \"to cease further testing, comply with the relevant Security Council resolutions, and allow space to explore the resumption of sincere dialogue on denuclearisation,\" read a statement by his spokesman.\nThe UN leader \"condemns the launch\" and said he will be discussing the situation \"with all concerned parties in the margins of the upcoming high level week of the United Nations General Assembly.\"\nSouth Korea tests its new cruise missile that could wipe out Kim from 300 miles\nThe hermit state had previously fired a Hwasong-12 intermediate range missile on August 29 which also overflew its Asian neighbours.\nThat also sparked emergency sirens and text alerts before it landed in the Pacific Ocean.\nSeoul's defence ministry said both missiles were fired in Sunan close to the capital's international airport.\nSouth Korea said the missile probably travelled around 3,700kms and reached a maximum altitude of 770kms - both higher and further than the previous device.\nFriday's missile flew over Hokkaido in northern Japan \"at around 07:06 am\" according to the country's J-Alert system.\nThe launch came as Donald Trump revealed tonight he plans to visit South Korea, China and Japan in November.\nEarlier Boris Johnson met Tillerson and vowed to punish tyrant Kim Jong-un for \u201cdefying the world\u201d. Johnson later tweeted that the international community would stand up to despotic Kim.\nThe UK and U.S. said they would push for tougher oil sanctions to be imposed in a way to cause maximum pressure.\nAP:Associated Press North Korea says its last firing of a missile over Japan was \"the first step\" of military operations in the Pacific\nEPA An E-3 Sentry Airborne Warning and Control System aircraft takes off from Osan Air Base in Pyeongtaek, South Korea\nKim's regime has now successfully tested two Hwasong-14 long-range rockets over the Pacific Ocean.\nIts most recent nuclear test - the most powerful yet - was a sophisticated 120 kiloton hydrogen bomb. detonated last Sunday (September 3).\nWith backing from China and Russia, the UN council voted earlier this week 15-0 to back the US-drafted ban on textile exports and restricting shipments of fuel to Pyongyang.\nThis could drain millions of dollars from its economy.\nExports of coal, lead and seafood were also banned last month after the launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile.\nNew North Korea propaganda video celebrates its missile capability as tensions in region rise\nAccording to US military sources, North Korea has been spotted moving mobile missile launchers and preparing test sites.\nEarlier today the secretive state ramped up its threats towards America.\n\u201cThe army and people of the DPRK are unanimously demanding that the Yankees, chief culprit in cooking up the sanctions resolution, be beaten to death as a stick is fit for a rabid dog,\u201d a statement released by the Korean Central News Agency read.\n\"Now is the time to annihilate the U.S. imperialist aggressors.\n\"Let's reduce the US mainland into ashes and darkness.\"\nWorld stocks were mostly lower on Friday after the launch.
