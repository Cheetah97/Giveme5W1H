The US should be wholly responsible for the catastrophic consequences it will entail.\"\nAP:Associated Press South Korean army's K-9 self-propelled howitzers move on the street in Paju, South Korea\nEPA A U-2 ultra-high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft lands at the US air force's Osan air base, south of Seoul, South Korea\nAP:Associated Press South Korean soldiers carry out an army exercise today as tensions in the region mount\nForeign Secretary Boris Johnson has said he is \"outraged\" by the \"reckless provocation\" of North Korea's latest missile launch\nJapan will take all measures to ensure people's safety says Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\nTrump responded: \"The world has received North Korea's latest message loud and clear: this regime has signalled its contempt for its neighbours, for all members of the United Nations, and for minimum standards of acceptable international behaviour.\n\"Threatening and destabilising actions only increase the North Korean regime's isolation in the region and among all nations of the world. All options are on the table.\"\nThe South also released footage of new missiles, which can travel as far as 497 miles and are close to being operationally deployed, being tested as world leaders rallied to condemn the tubby tyrant.\nJapanese residents were forced to hide underground after North Korea launched a missile over the country and into the Pacific Ocean at 6am local time - escalating nuclear fears to a new height.\nAustralia condemn North Korea's latest missile launch\u200b over Japan\u200b\nOfficials said it was the first time the communist state has fired a midrange ballistic missile designed to carry a nuclear payload over Japan before it splashed into the northern Pacific Ocean.\nThe missile was launched at 6am before breaking into pieces and plunging into the ocean- in what is thought to have been another threat against US territory Guam.\nAny launch going in the direction of the US territory of Guam would also have to pass through Japanese airspace.\nIt is likely the longest range launch ever undertaken by Kim Jong-un's nation flying over a key ally of the United States in the region and was the first time North Korea has fired a rocket over Japan since 2009.\nThe missile travelled around 1,677 miles before it broke into three pieces and landed in the sea off the east coast of Hokkaido, according to NHK.\nAlarm from the JP Gov again. \"A North Korean missile passed over this area.

Jong-Un, stating: \"International society, including Russia and China, need to take this seriously and increase pressure.\"\nA White House statement after the phone call said the two leaders \"agreed

to protect the lives of our people and the security of our nation.\"\nSouth Korea's statement following the launch \"The Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK) conducted a ballistic missile launch in Sunan, Pyongyang, on August 29. \"The Government of the Republic of Korea (ROK) condemns in the strongest terms this provocation by the DPRK which was conducted yet again despite the firm message of the international community conveyed through the adoption of United Nations Security Council Resolution 2371 in response to the repeated provocations of the DPRK. \"The DPRK regime should clearly understand that denuclearization is the only genuine path towards guaranteeing its security and economic development. \"Instead of reckless provocations, the DPRK should promptly come out to the path of dialogue for denuclearization. \"If the DPRK continues its nuclear and missile provocations, the ROK government will respond strongly based upon a stalwart ROK-US alliance. \"The ROK Government maintains a robust readiness posture capable of responding to any threats by the DPRK and will remain steadfast in safeguarding the lives of its people and the security of the nation.\"\nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also branded the provocative action a \"most serious and grave\" threat.\nAbe had a 40 minute phone conversation with Donald Trump following the launch saying the two leaders had agreed to call for an immediate emergency meeting of the UN security council \"and increase the pressure towards North Korea.\"\nHe added that the US President reiterated his assertion that the United States \"stands with Japan 100 per cent\".\nEarlier this month Trump warned North Korea would \"be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen\" if it threatened the US.\nSouth Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said it was \"jointly analysing for details\" with the US but didn't immediately confirm how far the projectile travelled and where it landed.\nJapanese officials said the military did not attempt to shoot down the missile and there was no damage to ships or anything else reported.\nJapan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has said he will do all in his power to protect the country.\nSpeaking briefly as he attended an emergency meeting on the firing, he said: \"We will make utmost efforts to firmly protect the lives of the people.\"\nForeign Secretary Boris Johnson has said he is \"outraged\" by the \"reckless provocation\" of North Korea's latest missile launch.\nAustralia also joined the chorus of international condemnation with political leaders in the country branding the action \"illegal, provocative and threatening\".\nMOST READ IN NEWS 'I'M MADDIE!'
