  "text": "A Request From Moscow\nAppleby, based in Bermuda, is one of the world\u2019s largest offshore law firms. Its files offer a rare inside look at more than a dozen aircraft trusts structured by American financial institutions for privacy-seeking plane owners, primarily foreigners who otherwise would not be allowed to register with the F.A.A. There is a premium on American registration because it increases a plane\u2019s resale value, the bureaucratic requirements are less costly and complex, and it is believed to draw less scrutiny as the aircraft moves around the world.\nAmong the plane owners seeking Appleby\u2019s services were Shaher Abdulhak, a Yemeni businessman worth an estimated $9 billion whose investments included a Coca-Cola distributor in the Middle East; UPL, an Indian producer of industrial chemicals and pesticides; and Rashid Sardarov, a Russian oil billionaire and longtime client of Mossack Fonseca, the law firm whose leaked records in 2015 became known as the Panama Papers.\nIn serving these clients, files show, Appleby dealt with the two banks that are the most prolific creators of American aircraft trusts: Wells Fargo and Bank of Utah. It is easy to see how Wells Fargo, the third-largest bank in the United States, with nearly $2 trillion in assets and offices in 42 countries, might find a lucrative niche catering to the wealthy elite. Less obvious is how Bank of Utah, with 18 branches confined to one state, took the same path.\nAs it happens, a group of former Wells Fargo trust officers joined Bank of Utah about 10 years ago and created what would become a profitable part of the bank\u2019s business. The bank collected $8.8 million in trust fees in 2016 \u2014 an increase of $1.1 million from the previous year, according to its most recent annual report.\nMr. Croasmun and Mr. Hansen took issue with the suggestion that they were exploiting a loophole to bypass restrictions on foreigners registering aircraft in the United States. By filling the role of \u201cU.S. citizen\u201d for registration purposes, the bank provided a valuable service for, say, multinational companies whose top executives might not be American, they said. The bank is clearly sensitive to concerns raised about the trusts. Its website carries a statement distancing itself from the planes it registers in its name, noting its only role is that of trustee.\nGot a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.\nIn the case of Mr. Mikhelson, the trail leading from Russia to Utah began in September 2012, with an email to Appleby from the Moscow office of the accounting firm Ernst & Young. The firm wanted Appleby to set up a complex corporate structure for an unnamed client to purchase a Gulfstream jet, valued at roughly $65 million, and retain possession of it through a chain of companies in six countries.\nFrom the outset, the goal was clear: \u201cThis structure,\u201d wrote Svetlana Yakushina of Ernst & Young, \u201cshould allow registering the aircraft with the aviation authorities of the United States.\u201d\nHow a Wealthy Foreigner Obtains U.S. Registration for a Private Jet The Russian oligarch Leonid Mikhelson wants to buy and register a private jet in the U.S., which requires American citizenship or residency. So a company he owns in Belize uses its company in the Cayman Islands, which uses its company in the British Virgin Islands to create a new company in Panama to buy the jet and record it in the Isle of Man for tax purposes, and to enter into a trusteeship with the Bank of Utah, which registers the jet in the U.S.\nThe arrangement would also permit the owner to avoid certain taxes, most notably a value-added tax of 20 percent if the jet were registered and used in the European Union. A six-page memo prepared by Ernst & Young laid out a plan to exploit a tax loophole offered by the Isle of Man, where about 1,000 privately owned aircraft are recorded on a government registry for tax purposes. Appleby and other similar firms maintain offices there.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nThe Isle of Man allows owners to escape the value-added tax, or VAT, through a paper-shuffling scheme, wherein the jet is held by a company based there but leased to another company elsewhere, both controlled by the same owner. The tax is technically deferred into the future, through use of a special account managed by Ernst & Young, and then canceled out by the corporate structure. Research by the investigative journalists consortium suggests that Isle of Man-registered aircraft have escaped more than $1 billion in taxes.\nAccording to a flow chart created by Appleby\u2019s Isle of Man office for the Mikhelson account, the ownership chain for his jet began in Panama, with a company called Golden Star Aviation, which registered on the Isle of Man and then leased the aircraft to a Cayman Islands company called SWGI Growth Fund. Both companies were controlled by Mr. Mikhelson.\nMr. Mikhelson declined to answer questions about his plane. His representative released a statement saying, \u201cMr. Mikhelson acts strictly within the boundaries of the law and in compliance with applicable legislation at all times.\u201d\nBy June 2013, lawyers at Appleby still had not learned of Mr. Mikhelson\u2019s role, other than being told that the Gulfstream\u2019s owner was Russian. Once the lawyers were informed of his identity by a Swiss firm that manages Mr. Mikhelson\u2019s finances, they conducted a background check and concluded that, as with other clients from Russia, where the political and legal environment can be unstable, working for him would be \u201chigh risk.\u201d But they decided to proceed.\nPhoto\nSanctions and \u2018Citizenship\u2019\nA due-diligence report by Appleby noted Mr. Mikhelson\u2019s source of wealth \u2014 valued currently at about $18 billion \u2014 from oil and gas investments, notably through Novatek, Russia\u2019s largest nongovernment-owned gas company. Mr. Mikhelson\u2019s main business partner is Gennady Timchenko, a close friend of Mr. Putin\u2019s. The two businessmen are the primary investors in Sibur, a Russian gas-processing company.\nIncluded in the report was a list of questions to determine if Mr. Mikhelson had any connections to the United States, including whether he had assets or maintained an address there. The answer to all of them was \u201cno.\u201d Flight records show that the plane has rarely, if ever, flown to the United States and instead makes trips within Russia or occasionally to cities in Europe and China.\nDespite its lack of a connection to the United States, Mr. Mikhelson\u2019s private jet was soon on its way to securing a registration with the F.A.A., thanks to Bank of Utah.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nIt is not clear if the bank was ever told, or inquired, about the identity of the owner of the aircraft. Mr. Croasmun said that files indicated the owner \u201cwas Russian\u201d but that identifying details were missing.\nWhatever the case, the trust agreement for Mr. Mikhelson\u2019s Gulfstream, filed with the F.A.A., does not name him anywhere in the document. Instead, the owner is listed as Golden Star Aviation, the Panamanian company he used to buy the plane. Attached to it is an \u201caffidavit of citizenship\u201d signed by a bank officer, Brett King, attesting that the trustee \u2014 Bank of Utah \u2014 is a \u201ccitizen of the United States.\u201d",
