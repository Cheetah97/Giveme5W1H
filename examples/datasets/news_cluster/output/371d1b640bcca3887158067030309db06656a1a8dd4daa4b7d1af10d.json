  "text": "The director and stars of Season 4's \"Star Trek\" tribute reveal a ton of details about the anthology episode's production.\n[Editor\u2019s note: Spoilers follow for the \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d Season 4 episode \u201cUSS Callister.\u201d]\nThe first episode of \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d Season 4 might be its most brilliant. Playing with tropes established by shows like \u201cStar Trek,\u201d it tells the story of a frustrated and petty programmer (Jesse Plemons) who imprisons those he feels have wronged him in a virtual game world. The longest episode of the season, \u201cUSS Callister\u201d creates multiple realities that come together to tackle not just a journey of the bullied becoming the bully, but an overall climate that has become incredibly toxic\u2026 but with some hope for true change.\nIndieWire spoke with \u201cCallister\u201d director Toby Haynes, production designer Joel Collins, and stars Plemons and Cristin Milioti to learn everything we could about how the episode came together, including how much work the Shatner impression took and how they got Aaron Paul for the episode\u2019s final moments.\n\u201cFive Pages In, I Was Completely Hooked\u201d\nOne thing Plemons and Haynes had in common when reading the script for the first time: The beginning left them bewildered.\nUpon first reading, in fact, Plemons explained that he was extremely confused by the first eight pages. \u201cSci-fi isn\u2019t really my realm, and I never really envisioned myself playing a commander of a space fleet,\u201d he said.\nBut he also hadn\u2019t watched \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d before, despite the urging of friends, so he stopped reading and decided to watch a few episodes of the show, ultimately bingeing the entire first season before going back to the script. \u201cThen I made it to the second scene, and immediately got it, and loved it,\u201d Plemons said. \u201cI decided pretty quickly after that that I wanted to do it.\u201d\nAccording to Plemons, his first conversation with Brooker involved just trying to find out what the inspiration was. \u201cIt\u2019s so out there. He said he plays video games, and he also mentioned \u2018Toy Story\u2019 as being some sort of influence, which I thought was really interesting. Like the darkest version of \u2018Toy Story\u2019 you can imagine,\u201d Plemons said.\nMeanwhile, when Haynes was sent the script, the first few pages had him worried that the project wasn\u2019t much of a departure for him, given his past work on shows like \u201cDoctor Who.\u201d\nJonathan Prime\n\u201cI felt like I\u2019ve done this before and I was all in the back of my head, thinking, \u2018Is this all I can do?'\u201d he said. \u201cI told my agent that and he said, \u2018Just keep reading. For goodness sake, just keep reading! It\u2019s jolly worth the read.\u2019 Then, five pages in, I was completely hooked. I just read it in one go and I completely ate the script up\u2026 I just knew I had to direct it. I knew I wanted it to be my challenge.\u201d\n\u201cThe Schedule Was So Horrible\u201d\nHaynes said that when he went to meet with the producers, \u201cI think I did pretty well holding it together for most of the interview, until the end where I just begged to do it.\u201d It got him the job, but then came, in his words, \u201cthe crushing disclosure as to the actual budget and schedule.\u201d\nIn order to make \u201cCallister\u201d happen, things had to move incredibly fast, and it was a pressure Milioti definitely felt. \u201cWe were shooting so many pages a day, and they were such intense scenes and they were technically intense, too, so I was trying to focus on just how to get these words out in two takes,\u201d she said.\nHow tight was the schedule? As just one example, Haynes noted that all the office sequences for the episode were shot in just three days. Fortunately, the cast was up for it. \u201cWe had to move so quickly. We were doing 14 page days and they really had to nail it on like take one or two,\u201d Haynes said. \u201cAnd they did. They were so sharp. So smart. And knew their characters so well. They had to play three different versions of themselves, and they delivered that.\u201d\nAdded Haynes, \u201cEvery scene that was on the spaceship was just always about geeking out about being in a spaceship and with a cast like this, with material as good as this. But equally I was petrified that we wouldn\u2019t finish it in time. That we wouldn\u2019t be able to do it justice, because the script was so good, but the schedule was so horrible. We thought, \u2018Are we going to be able to do our best work under these kind of pressures?\u2019 And actually, I think the pressure helped. Everybody rose to the challenge and delivered their best work.\u201d\n\u201cTurn Up the Shatner\u201d\nOne element that stands out right from the beginning was the inspiration Plemons drew from perhaps television\u2019s most iconic starship captain \u2014 Captain James T. Kirk, as portrayed by William Shatner in the original \u201cStar Trek.\u201d\nWhile it wasn\u2019t initially a part of the initial \u201cCallister\u201d pitch, Plemons said that \u201cit just became obvious that there\u2019s no way to do this without giving some sort of homage to Shatner.\u201d So, in order to nail down the voice, Plemons worked with a vocal coach for the weeks leading up to production to find just the right cadence, and also watched a great deal of \u201cTrek,\u201d even listening to audio clips of Shatner on set in between takes.\n\u201cHe was very funny,\u201d Haynes said. \u201cHe would say things like, \u2018If you ever need me to turn up the Shatner, I can do that for you.\u2019 That\u2019s what he\u2019d say. That was great fun.\u201d\nMilioti noted that the reason the Shatner tribute works so well is that \u201cit\u2019s not a straight-up mimicry. It\u2019s colored by it in a way that\u2019s so fantastic.\u201d\nAs someone who wasn\u2019t all that into \u201cStar Trek\u201d beforehand, Plemons found that part of the fun of embodying Shatner came from the Canadian actor\u2019s background. \u201cShatner\u2019s so entertaining, and he takes it so seriously,\u201d he said. \u201cI found out that he was a Shakespearean-trained actor, and I think that really comes across when you watch \u2018Star Trek,\u2019 or anything he does. He treats the words as if they\u2019re Shakespeare. It\u2019s very theatrical\u2026 He either goes way over the top with what he\u2019s doing, or just completely throws it away. It\u2019s just a lot of fun to play around with that.\u201d\nIt was Plemons\u2019 first time dealing with technobabble, it\u2019s worth noting, and he said that \u201cit was definitely tricky going over the dialogue enough times to make it feel like it was something you were familiar with, and used on a daily basis. All that watching hours and hours of \u2018Star Trek\u2019 helped quite a bit.\u201d\n\u201cThe Most Fun Thing You Can Imagine\u201d\n\u201cCallister\u201d was filmed at Twickenham Studios just outside of London, beginning with the sequences inside of the Infinity system, followed by the \u201creal world\u201d scenes in Daly\u2019s apartment and the Callister offices.\nBuilding the set for the Callister ship included some nuance beyond what you might initially notice, because according to production designer Joel Collins, \u201cwe had to design a spaceship, and we also had to transcend some history. The fan history of a fake show, you know?\u201d\nThis was because in the beginning, the USS Callister is rooted in the retro design of Daly\u2019s favorite show, echoing how the visual style of \u201cStar Trek\u201d in the 1960s looks very different from the franchise\u2019s current look.\n\u201c\u2018Star Trek\u2019 transitioned, and fans stayed with it most of the time,\u201d Collins said. \u201cBut some love the old stuff, and some like the new stuff. So somewhere in the development of the feel of the ship, and then the game that [Daly]\u2019s created, which pays homage to that, we had to trope, to a point, those types of shows, but also make it a design able to transcend into what maybe J.J. Abrams would have done with the show further down the line.\u201d\nThere, Collins is referring to the end of the episode, when the Callister crew escapes Daly\u2019s closed system and finds themselves in the main game universe. In fact, as Collins describes, the world of the Callister changes a few times over the course of the episode: \u201cIt goes from the show reality that you\u2019re watching, through to the people who are stuck within the ship\u2019s reality, through to the upgraded, new upload that hits and re-skins the entire ship, putting them into the modern game that they finally end up in.\u201d\nHaynes was thrilled by the end result. \u201cThe design department for \u2018Black Mirror\u2019 is one of the best design departments I have ever worked with,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve done every single episode. They\u2019ve conceptualized the future so many times over\u2026 I knew that I was working with the A-team and it was a question of raising your game, not the other way around. It was always about making sure that we were getting the best for the script.\u201d\n\u201cThe most fun thing you can imagine,\u201d Milioti said of walking onto the set for the first time. \u201cThe coolest thing you could ever imagine in your life. It was certainly the coolest set that I\u2019ve ever gotten to play on.\u201d\nLess fun was the official Space Fleet uniform for women, though Milioti did say that it was perfect, given the scenario.\n\u201cThis is exactly what this guy would make women wear. It was exactly how this misogynistic, sheltered, warped mind would be like, \u2018Yes, this is what women should wear, the most uncomfortable thing possible to show off their bodies,'\u201d she said. \u201cWe could barely move in those things. We just were freezing all the time because it was a very cold set. I loved it. It helped so much because I was so uncomfortable in it all the time, and that\u2019s exactly what it would be like.\u201d\nRead More: Every \u2018Black Mirror\u2019 Episode Ranked, From Worst to Best\n\u201cSlowly, The Hero Shifts Places\u201d\nFor Plemons, shifting from playing Daly in the virtual world to playing Daly in the real world wasn\u2019t a massive challenge \u2014 thanks to his hair.\n\u201cIt was something in the initial script that I really liked, which was that he was fairly sad in real life. A sad sight,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they describe him as balding, and overweight, and just uncomfortable in his own skin.\u201d\nAt the time of filming, Plemons had long enough hair to create the perfect \u2018do for his \u201cSpace Fleet\u201d look, but in trying to create his real-life look, he decided he didn\u2019t want to go with a bald cap. \u201cEvery time I see that in a movie, you can kind of tell, and so, I decided to just go for it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe hair ladies were very surprised, but looking in the mirror after we gave myself a receding hairline and bald spot, that made it a lot easier to slip into real Daly. Just walking around with that.\u201d\nHaynes called Plemons \u201ca gift of an actor to work with. He\u2019d just get on with it.\u201d But he also noted that they didn\u2019t initially bond, because \u201che was spooky to work with initially because he was playing Captain Daly, like a powerful Daly, who is a sort of dictator.\u201d\nAnd then, when they shifted to shooting the office sequences, Haynes said that Plemons was \u201ctotally different. You wanted to kind of give him a hug. He was so sad and kind of lonely.\u201d\nIt was a contrast that spoke to the way Daly\u2019s personal traumas end up affecting the people he enslaves. \u201cYou see he has every right to be as angry as he is. It\u2019s what you choose to do with that, and it\u2019s the way you react to the adversity in your life, and he reacts to it in a way that\u2019s unconscionable,\u201d Milioti said. \u201cBut he\u2019s just not like an archvillain. You understand why this guy is where he\u2019s at, but I love that. Slowly, the hero shifts places.\u201d\nPlemons noted that \u201cI think everyone has a sort of real self, and a fantasy self, or version of themselves they would like to be thought of as, and aren\u2019t really allowed to experience that in real life. So it comes out under the blanket, or whatever, online. I don\u2019t know how conscious I was of making him sympathetic, or anything like that in the beginning. But as it played out, like, my God, it was pretty brutal\u2026 Just that opening sequence. I understand how that could drive someone to do what he does.\u201d\nWhich stands in sharp contrast to what Nanette experiences, in Milioti\u2019s words: \u201cShe just distances herself in a fucking work environment\u2026 I mean, we couldn\u2019t be more in the midst of that element of it being timely if we tried. And he takes her and throws her into this torture chamber because she makes him feel small, when she\u2019s just trying to work and not be harassed.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s Just Ask Aaron\u201d\nIn case you weren\u2019t paying attention to the closing credits of the episode: Yes, that was Emmy winner Aaron Paul making a quick voice-over cameo at the end as \u201cgamer691\u201d \u2014 something which even surprised the cast when they first screened the episode, as it was one of the last elements that came into place.\nAs Haynes explained, they experimented with a few different approaches for the unseen gamer that the Callister crew encounters in the final moments, as the original idea was for the character to be \u201cmore geeky, more of a squeaky voice, like a little kid.\u201d\nBut Brooker wasn\u2019t happy with the way it was playing, because according to Haynes, \u201che felt that trying to make a joke about computer game users being creepy felt very wrong to him. [Brooker] is a gamer, and he felt like it was talking down to the audience.\u201d\nThe solution they ultimately landed on was that \u201cit was more interesting if they come through this horrible journey and the first person that they come in contact with is somebody who doesn\u2019t give a shit,\u201d Haynes said. \u201cSo we needed a voice that doesn\u2019t give a shit and\u2026 I was like, \u2018What accent do you want, Charlie?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Well, what about Jesse from \u2018Breaking Bad\u2019?\u2019 That kind of \u2018Hey y\u2019all, fuck that\u2019 voice.\u201d\nThat\u2019s when casting director Jina Jay said, \u201cWell, let\u2019s just ask Aaron. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll do it.\u201d\nTurns out, she was right. \u201cIt was fantastic,\u201d Haynes said. \u201cWe got him on the phone and we had a wonderful couple hours recording that and playing with it.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re Hopefully Flushing Out This Shit\u201d\nWhile the harassment issues \u201cCallister\u201d embodies might feel incredibly relevant to this exact moment in our culture, the episode was actually shot much earlier in 2017. That said, the fact that it was filmed around the time of Trump\u2019s inauguration definitely had an impact.\n\u201cWhat I find interesting is that none of us knew about the Weinstein scandal that was yet to come,\u201d Haynes said. \u201cThis huge kind of flushing out of toxic masculinity that is happening in our industry. That was yet to happen, [but] it has resonance about all of that stuff about masculinity and what it is to be a bully and what it is to hold power over someone. And it\u2019s just great that it\u2019s sort of come out in our industry now that we\u2019re hopefully flushing out this shit, basically.\u201d\nMilioti noted that during filming, the cast and crew took a break to join the Women\u2019s March in London, and the storyline had a major impact on her at that moment. \u201cI think that for me, this felt a little bit, probably unconsciously at first, the story that I wish I would\u2019ve seen in life, that this woman who is a hard worker and doesn\u2019t take any shit beats this small-minded bully at his own game. I don\u2019t know. I sort of loved that, that she calls upon this inner strength to defeat this person who is in the wrong.\u201d\nShe added, \u201cI also think it\u2019s a story about that we have more inner strength than we realize. I sort of feel like [Nanette] finds her truest self in that world, in the fake world, because at work she\u2019s trying to be not too much of a bitch and be sweet about it even though she\u2019s kind of being harassed\u2026 I hope that\u2019s one of the takeaways, that this person who I think you kind of underestimate a little bit at the beginning as this sweet girl at the office, can captain a fucking spaceship and can defeat a pretty enormous evil presence.\u201d\nSomeone Please Cast Cristin Milioti As a Starship Captain\nThe final minutes of \u201cCallister\u201d set up what could be an amazing new series (if \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d were the type of show to do that sort of thing), with Nanette taking the captain\u2019s chair almost by default \u2014 something that genuinely thrilled Milioti.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe that I got to do that,\u201d she said. \u201cI was so devastated when this ended. I wanted to see where they would go next. I loved shooting this so much. I was so sad that it was only five weeks. I could\u2019ve done this for months\u2026I was really, really sad when it was over, and I would go do it again in a heartbeat. If they had a sequel to that episode, I would not even think twice.\u201d\n\u201cBlack Mirror\u201d Season 4 is streaming now on Netflix. Additional reporting by Steve Greene.",
