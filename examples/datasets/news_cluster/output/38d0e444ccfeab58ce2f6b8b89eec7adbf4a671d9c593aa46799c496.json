  "text": "Police in Cologne are investigating a staggering 359 sexual assaults and a total of 821 complaints after a migrant mob went on the rampage in the city on New Year's Eve.\nIn figures released by the state government in North Rhine-Westphalia, the full extent of crimes ranging from pick pocketing to gang rape, police are investigating is laid bare in what has been dubbed a 'list of shame'.\nIt shows that a total of 359 sexual assaults have been reported to German police and that 659 women are recorded as having been victims of the mob.\nPolice in Cologne are investigating a staggering 359 sexual assaults and a total of 821 complaints after a migrant mob went on the rampage in the city on New Year's Eve close to the cathedral, pictured\nThe report also reveals that when the number of complaints in Cologne is added to those elsewhere in North Rhine-Westphalia in cities such as Dortmund and Dusseldorf, a total of 1,049 crimes are being investigated.\nThe new shocking figures come as Cologne Police said they were investigating 30 people from North African countries in connection with the New Years Eve attacks for robbery, theft and trafficking stolen goods.\nEight suspects are currently in detention, with one of them is accused of sexual assault for allegedly groping a woman.\nThe report also reveals that when the number of complaints in Cologne is added to those elsewhere in North Rhine-Westphalia in cities such as Dortmund and Dusseldorf, a total of 1,049 crimes are being investigated\nWomen were said to have been attacked during a fireworks display in the square by the cathedral in front of Cologne's train station\nThe figures were released by state government minister Ralf Jaeger who said all of the suspects were of North African descent and 15 of them did not have paperwork to prove they were given indefinite leave to remain in Germany.\nThe figures were released by state government minister Ralf Jaeger who said all of the suspects were of North African descent\nHe said another two were under the age of 18.\nThe figures come after police logs from the night, released yesterday showed the full horror the women experienced when they were set upon by the out-of-control mob of men on the steps of the city's historic cathedral.\nThe notes reveal how women complained they were surrounded by men who tried to put their hands inside their underwear.\nOne woman told police she was surrounded by 20 men of North African appearance before they attacked her, while another said hands were 'all over her breasts and buttocks'.\nThieves rifled through a woman's handbag while others distracted her by shoving their hands underneath her clothes.\nIn an appalling catalogue of complaints, the women who were attacked during a fireworks display in the square by the cathedral in front of Cologne's train station told how they had mobile phones, bank cards and cash stolen.\nIt has since emerged that similar 'mob sex assaults' have been carried out in other German cities and other European countries, including Sweden, Finland and Austria.\nAfter reports that the attacks were carried out by 'mainly Arabic and North African men', protests have been held all over Europe to limit migration into the EU.",
