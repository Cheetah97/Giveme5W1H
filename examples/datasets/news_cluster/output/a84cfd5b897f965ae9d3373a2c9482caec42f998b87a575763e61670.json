A male gorilla is standing over him.\"\nThere are then repeated shouts of \"be calm, be calm\" as she struggles to contain her panic.\nThe distressed mother can then be heard saying: \"He's dragging my son, I can't watch this.\"\nIsiah's family released a statement today thanking their supporters - despite a worldwide public backlash against them.\nThey urged people to donate money in Harambe's name.\nRelated stories It happened to me \u2018My husband died while I was pregnant\u2019: One mum's account of love and loss PIVOTAL MOMENT Tomorrow's clash with Portugal will be England's 50th game at the new Wembley Stadium Trouble in store Fears grow that customers have being paying out BILLIONS in store card claims for last 40 years Break It Off Taylor Swift and Calvin Harris split after 15 month romance\nThe statement said: \"Our child has had a checkup by his doctor and is still doing well.\n\"We continue to praise God for His grace and mercy, and to be thankful to the Cincinnati Zoo for their actions taken to protect our child.\n\"We are also very appreciative for the expressions of concern and support that have been sent to us.\n\"Some have offered money to the family, which we do not want and will not accept. If anyone wishes to make a gift, we recommend a donation to the Cincinnati Zoo in Harambe\u2019s name.\"\nSince Harambe was killed, mum-of-four Michelle has become the victim of online abuse from animal lovers who claim Harambe was trying to protect young Isaiah when he was \"murdered\".\nAlmost 300,000 people have signed a petition calling for \"justice for Harambe\" after hitting out at zoo chiefs over their decision to kill Harambe.\nProsecutor Joseph T. Deters today said in a statement: \"The incident at the Cincinnati Zoo involving the young child who fell into the gorilla enclosure is under investigation by the Cincinnati Police Department.\nHarambe, who was 17, was shot dead by zookeepers\nMARK STGEORGE The family has faced a public backlash after forcing keepers to shoot the gorilla\n\"Once their investigation is concluded, they will confer with our office on possible criminal charges.\n\"When the investigation and review are complete, we will update the media.\"\nPictures also emerged today of the short fence -seemingly easy for a child to climb over - which surrounds the moat at the zoo's gorilla enclosure.\nCincinnati Zoo 's gorilla display has been closed to the public since the weekend.\nThe fence, around three foot at the most, appears to be made of metal and wire and could be easy for a child to climb.\nOnly a short hedge seems to separate the barrier and the fall into the deep moat - beyond which a gorilla can be seen in the background.\nA warning sign in the picture reads: \"BE ALERT! Gorillas are known to throw objects such as clumps of dirt\".\nThe picture is understood to be four years old.\nThe director of Cincinnati Zoo has insisted the horizontal barriers at the gorilla\u2019s enclosure were secure \u2013 insisting it they were not at fault.\nToday pictures also emerged of the enclosure fence which appears easy to get over\nTwitter / @ForIamPJ Zoo directors insisted the barriers were safe and said \"any of us could get over if we wanted to\"\nThane Maynard said: \u201cWe take safety very seriously and we are keenly interested in improvement.\n\u201cAny of us could climb over barriers if we choose. As I said, you can lock your car or lock your house, but if someone wants to get in, they can.\u201d\nDramatic video footage shows the beast picking up the lad and pulling him through water as witnesses \u2014 including the boy\u2019s mum \u2014 screamed.\nThe boy\u2019s mum Michelle can be heard shouting: \u201cMummy\u2019s right here. Isaiah, be calm. Mummy loves you.\u201d\nBut it was claimed the gorilla, who turned 17 on Friday, was simply trying to protect him and the pair can even be seen holding hands at one point.\nWe pay for your stories!
